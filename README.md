# Research Mapper
This application serves to map out the _who_ and _what_ of research that I find is interesting.

It currently focuses on papers published on arxiv.

Given an [arxiv ID](https://info.arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier.html) it will utilize the [python library](https://pypi.org/project/arxiv/) to pull paper titles and authors.
