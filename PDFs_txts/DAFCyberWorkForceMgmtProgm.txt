Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Overview. 
1.1.1.  The DAF Cyberspace Workforce Management Program furthers the Department’s 
obligations to support DoD’s goals to develop a DoD cybersecurity workforce with a common 
understanding of the concepts, principles, and applications of cyberspace; to establish the 
DCWF as the authoritative reference for the identification, tracking, and reporting of 
cyberspace positions; and to manage and align specific workforce elements for each category, 
level, and cyberspace work function to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
under an enterprise model of DoD information, Information Systems, networks, and the 
information stored within. 
1.1.2.  The DAF maintains a Total Force management posture to qualify and enable authorized 
cyberspace government employed civilian, military, and foreign national personnel to perform 
cyberspace roles and responsibilities. Contracted services supports and augments these 
personnel, where appropriate. These personnel and contracted services, collectively function 
as an integrated workforce with complementary skill sets to provide an agile, flexible response 
to meet DAF mission requirements. The appropriate mix of government civilian, military, and 
contracted support personnel designated to perform in cyberspace work roles is determined in 
accordance with DoDI 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix. 
1.1.3.  All persons performing cyberspace work roles must be identified in respective 
authoritative manpower and personnel systems and fully qualified according to DoD standards 
and all DAF specific workforce qualification and training requirements as outlined in this 
manual. 
1.1.4.  Cyberspace work comprises tasks executed by personnel assigned to workforce 
elements, which include Information Technology (IT), Cybersecurity, Cyberspace effects, 
Intelligence workforce (cyberspace), Cyberspace enablers, Software Engineering, and 
AI/Data. 
1.1.5.  The DCWF is the reference model for the identification, tracking, and reporting of DoD 
cyberspace positions and establishes the baseline of cyberspace workforce qualifications. All 
positions requiring the execution of cyberspace work must be DCWF coded in accordance with 
DoDD 8140.01. 
1.1.6.  This manual identifies DAF cyberspace workforce positions and qualification 
requirements. It also provides policy on workforce reporting, metrics, and validation, and 
provides a structure towards moving the Civilian and Military Cyber Workforce toward 
modernization as provided by the DCWF in accordance with DoDI 8140.02 (resources 
available on the DoD Cyber Exchange Website at https://www.cyber.mil). The requirements 
specified in this manual are the minimum required, unless otherwise noted. Commanders and 
Program Managers are authorized to apply more stringent requirements to reflect specific 
mission directives and budget constraints. 
1.1.7.  This manual does not address the operational employment of the cyberspace roles. 
Operational employment of the cyberspace workforce is determined by mission requirements 
as directed by the Joint Staff, Combatant Command, and other DoD Components. Fully 
6 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
implemented, DCWF facilitates allocation of personnel according to mission needs at every 
organizational level. 
1.2.  Network Access Requirements 
1.2.1.  All users regardless of rank, position, or role requiring access to the AF Information 
Network (AFIN) Information System(s), or Platform Information Technology (PIT) Systems 
will complete initial Cyber Awareness training as a prerequisite for access. All users will 
complete refresher training to maintain network or system access as new versions are published 
and made available via SAF/CN approved means (T-1), which includes 1) the AF learning 
management system, MyLearning https://lms-jets.cce.af.mil/moodle/); 2) the DoD Cyber 
Exchange NIPR (Non-classified or Non-secure Internet Protocol Router) portal: 
https://www.cyber.mil; or 3) using any other method that SAF/CN designates. MyLearning 
is the preferred training method as it provides reporting updates to other DAF systems. All 
users must complete the training on an individual basis using the Computer Based Training 
(CBT) from an approved platform to receive initial or annual training credit. Group delivery 
may be used as a command tool but is specifically not DAF approved to satisfy initial or annual 
requirements. 
1.2.2.  Course updates normally occur about October of each year. Users without network 
access can take the course at the DoD Cyber Exchange Public portal and present their 
certificate of completion to their unit training manager to manually update their training record 
with the date of completion on the certificate. Users will refresh their training within 365 
calendar days when newer versions of the training becomes available. 
1.2.3.  User network access may be suspended by technical enforcement controls for non-
compliance with refresher training. The authoritative record for Cyber Awareness training 
status is stored in Air Force Information Directory (AFID). Unit training managers are 
authorized to manually update user training status via MyLearning when a user completes the 
training requirement off-network and presents proof of completion (i.e., certificate). 
1.2.4.  To promote DoD Enterprise reciprocity, users reporting to joint assignments, 
deployments, TDY, etc. or requiring access to other networks must ensure their training status 
has been refreshed within the past 90 days. They may be requested to present a hard or soft 
copy of their certificate by the gaining agency, organization, or unit. Users are responsible for 
maintaining their status through their date of return to their home unit. 
1.3.  Identification 
1.3.1.  All DAF civilian and military cyberspace workforce positions requiring performance of 
at least one cyberspace task must be identified on a Unit Manning Document (UMD) using 
established Special Experience Identifiers (SEIs) and all applicable DCWF work role and 
proficiency level codes via the appropriate Manpower Programming and Execution System 
(MPES) entries. 
1.3.2.  Civilian and military personnel: The cyberspace workforce information must be 
recorded in manpower and personnel databases or systems (e.g., Military Personnel Data 
System- MilPDS or Defense Civilian Personnel Data System-DCPDS [to be replaced by the 
Defense Civilian Human Resource Management System-DCHRMS]). The record will include 
the AF Specialty Code (AFSC), Space Force Specialty Code (SFSC), or civilian occupational 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
7 
series as a required data field as applicable. Relevant information is also recorded on civilian 
position description or core personnel documents. 
1.3.3.  Contractors: All cyberspace requirements including continuing education must be listed 
in the contract requirements and associated Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work 
Statement (PWS) in accordance with DoDM 8140.03 para 3.2. (T-0). Details on the contractor 
cyberspace workforce must be locally collected and tracked with the program office until such 
time as personnel and management systems can fully accommodate contractors (T-1). 
1.3.4.  Foreign nationals: All cyberspace requirements, consistent with appliable international 
agreements, including DCWF coding shall be locally collected and tracked with the program 
office and forwarded to the Wing/Delta Cyberspace Office until such time as personnel and 
management systems can fully accommodate them. A memorandum for record shall be 
forwarded to the MAJCOM/FLDCOM representative to include the list of names and position 
identification information (T-1).

Chapter 3 
GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURES 
3.1.  Description of the DoD Cyberspace Workforce Framework 
3.1.1.  The DCWF describes the work performed by the Cyberspace workforce and serves as 
a fundamental building block for the development of qualification standards and career 
planning, accession, and promotion through technical or managerial tracks. It is the DoD 
implementation of the Federal Cyber Workforce Assessment Act (FCWAA) of 2015 and is 
envisioned to help DoD organizations recruit, train, educate and retain a qualified cyberspace 
workforce. In accordance with DoDD 8140.01, the Cyberspace workforce is defined as: 
“personnel who build, secure, operate, defend, and protect DoD and U.S. cyberspace resources, 
conduct related intelligence activities, enable future operations, and project power in and 
through cyberspace.” A DAF position pursuing this mission, regardless of AFSC or SFSC, job 
title, occupational series, or contractor job title that performs one or more cyber-related tasks 
is part of the DoD cyberspace workforce. 
3.1.2.  The DCWF employs a hierarchical structure with categories, specialty areas, and work 
roles. Each role has three elements: 1) a definition; 2) a list of core and additional tasks; and 
3) KSAs that describe what is needed to execute critical functions. The DCWF standardizes 
naming, numbering convention, and descriptions of individual roles, tasks, and KSAs to 
support joint assignments, reciprocity, career development, and interoperability across the 
DoD Enterprise. 
3.1.3.  Cyberspace work roles align to one of 7 workforce elements. They are: 1) IT; 2) 
Cybersecurity; 3) Cyberspace Effects; 4) Cyberspace Intelligence workforce; 5) Cyberspace 
Enablers; 6) Software Engineering; and 7) AI/Data. DAF anticipates the workforce elements 
and/or alignment of the DCWF to be reviewed and updated annually under the authority of the 
CWMB and will be available on the DoD Cyber Exchange website, the authoritative source 
for published updates located at https://www.cyber.mil. This manual will be updated as 
necessary to accommodate major structural changes. 
3.1.4.  DCWF work roles contain an occupational descriptor, composed of a civilian 
occupational series or military occupational code (AFSC or SFSC), and a three-digit specialty 
code (for civilians and military), but they do not align with a specific occupation (T-0). They 
may however align with more than one career field or may be used alongside or in conjunction 
with other work roles. DCWF work roles always have associated KSAs and tasks. 
3.2.  Structure of the Workforce 
3.2.1.  The DCWF includes DoD civilian employees, military service members, and 
contractors assigned to positions requiring performance of cyberspace work and coded with a 
DCWF primary and additional work role codes as necessary. An individual may have up to 
three assigned work role codes (T-0). A proficiency level is assigned for each code. There is 
no prioritization required to be assigned among the additional roles, though they may be 
assigned to meet mission requirements.  The primary work role code identifies the work role 
that includes the majority of a position’s responsibilities and represent its most significant 
requirement. Codes may not be used more than once to describe any position. A position may 
require performance of the roles at different proficiency levels. 
22 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
3.2.2.  Each cyberspace work role has in its qualification matrix as many as four areas to 
identify the options available to achieve qualifications associated with each role. These areas 
are: 1) Foundational Qualifications composing of education, training, or certification. In some 
circumstances, actual experience performing in the role may serve as a conditional alternative; 
2) an optional foundational qualification based on experience; 3) a residential qualification that 
is based on demonstration of capability, which always includes a specific On-the-Job 
qualification and may include any environmental or organizational specific requirements; and 
4) continuous professional development of a minimum of 20 hours per year (or vendor 
certification maintenance minimums, whichever is greater). Additional information regarding 
the location and management of these matrices can be found on the DoD Cyber Exchange site 
at:  https://cyber.mil/wid/dod8140/qualifications-matrices. 
3.3.  Position Identification 
3.3.1.  While work role positions always have an associated proficiency requirement they are 
only to describe the levels of capability required to successfully perform the work and are not 
tied to any rank, grade, or seniority. They are defined by one of three designations: Basic, 
Intermediate, and Advanced. The definitions of each pursuant to DoDI 8140.02 paragraph 
4.a.(1)(b) are thus: 
3.3.1.1.  Basic - the role requires an individual to have familiarity with basic concepts and 
processes and the ability to apply these with frequent, specific guidance. An individual 
must be able to perform successfully in routine, structured situations. 
3.3.1.2.  Intermediate - the role requires an individual to have extensive knowledge of basic 
concepts and processes and experience applying these with only periodic high-level 
guidance. An individual must be able to perform successfully in non-routine and sometimes 
complicated situations. 
3.3.1.3.  Advanced - the role requires an individual to have an in-depth understanding of 
advanced concepts and processes and experience applying these with little to no guidance. 
An individual must be able to provide guidance to others. 
3.3.2.  Civilian positions in any designated cyber occupational series must have a designated 
cyberspace work role or a documented justification for lack of coding. All positions aligned to 
the 2210, 1550, 0332, and 0335 occupational series must be coded with DCWF work roles and 
proficiency levels (the requirements of this paragraph are relaxed during the DAF transition 
period in favor of allowances contained in paragraph 4.1.8.1 of this manual). 
3.3.3.  In accordance with DoDI 8140.02 paragraphs 4.b.(3 and 5), the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) guidance requires the use of the code “000” and at least one additional 
cyberspace work role code.  Any “000” position must also include an explanation for the use 
of “000” primary code, where a position has been determined as non-cyberspace (T-0). The 
four civilian occupations series listed in paragraph 3.3.2 of this manual are prohibited from 
using the “000” code. The CWMB will update specifics of the manner for explanation of use 
of the “000” code in the future. 
3.3.4.  Military position identification can be aided by use of the military occupation 
crosswalk, available for download at  
https://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/2019/military_crosswalk.zip. 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024

3.3.5.  Positions occupied by partner nation personnel are also coded. 
3.3.6.  Any person with privileged access must be coded as an IT privileged user, even if 
functioning in an alternate work role, with certain exceptions as noted in paragraph 4.3.2 of 
this manual. 
3.4.  Cyberspace Workforce Qualification and Management Program 
3.4.1.  As per DoDM 8140.03, the DoD Cyberspace Workforce Qualification and Management 
Program establishes enterprise baseline requirements by work role according to proficiency 
level to enhance cyberspace mission readiness across the DoD. 
3.4.2.  The standards are intended to be used in conjunction with OPM Qualification standards 
rather than as a replacement for those standards. The program is designed to develop a 
cyberspace workforce with a common understanding of the concepts, principles, and 
applications of cyberspace functions to enhance interoperability across organizations and 
mission sets. Cybersecurity KSAs must be integrated into the qualification requirements of all 
cyberspace work roles regardless of workforce element alignment. All training that meets the 
requirements of the DoD Cyberspace Operations Forces is accepted as meeting the 
qualification standards and requirements (T-0). 
3.4.3.  Meeting the foundational, residential, and continuing education requirements outlined 
are not waivable, though alternative means of meeting these requirements may be substituted 
under the authority of the CWMB (T-0) with the endorsement of SAF/CNSF. These 
requirements are explained in DoDM 8140.03 Chap 3.2 and additional information can be 
found with the qualification matrix information for appropriate work roles at: 
https://cyber.mil/wid/dod8140/qualifications-matrices. Use of the matrices and due care is 
mandatory to assure the integrity of the enterprise workforce.

Chapter 4 
PROCEDURES, EXCEPTIONS, AND WAIVERS 
4.1.  Normal and Amplified Procedures 
4.1.1.  DAF civilian and military personnel are qualified after meeting foundational and 
residential requirements within 12 months of assignment to their cyberspace duties; (2) 
publication of this manual; and (3) the position has been fully transitioned to DCWF.  
Completion of foundational requirements must be accomplished within the first nine months. 
Completion of residential requirements may be accomplished concurrently or after completion 
of foundational requirements. 
4.1.2.  Maintenance of qualification requires meeting a continuing education requirement of 
20 hours per annum. Personnel relying on a vendor-provided certification to meet foundational 
requirements must meet the greater of this 20-hour requirement or the vendor’s individualized 
continuing education requirements. 
4.1.3.  Time requirements commence on the date of assignment to each role assigned and 
assignment to additional roles does not extend time for any prior assigned roles. Continuing 
education requirements that have overlapping KSAs may be used to satisfy those requirements 
for any KSAs contained within the overlap. Proficiency level requirements may differ among 
roles, as necessary. 
4.1.4.  The primary work role code identifies work that encompasses the majority of a 
position’s responsibilities. A primary work role code other than “000” indicates that 
performance of work defined by the skillsets identified in the framework as the primary role 
of the position. Secondary and tertiary codes are used to capture other key work required of 
the position. The primary work role indicates that 50% or greater time is spent performing 
duties aligned to this work role and thus captures the most significant requirements of the 
position, where additional work roles are used.  Use “000,” with the appropriate justification, 
as the primary work role where a position is required to complete work aligned to a specific 
work role that does not constitute the majority of work duties (<50% time spent), (see 
paragraph 3.3 and subparagraphs of this manual).  Such positions require a secondary work 
role, tertiary work role, or both. 
4.1.5.  Contracted support personnel are required to meet foundational qualifications prior to 
the assumption of any duties but are not required to meet residential requirements unless 
required by the Authorizing Official and the requirements are described in the contract, SOW, 
or PWS. 
4.1.6.  Performance periods that have commenced prior to 15 Feb 2023 shall not be construed 
to contain such language imposing these requirements upon contractors unless those contracts 
or statements of work include or specify DCWF coding. Contracts shall be updated at the 
earliest, most feasible opportunity to include any new requirements since the publication of 
this manual. 
4.1.7.  Authorizing Officials may extend time limits prescribed in 4.1.1. for a specifically dated 
period, not to exceed six months by authorizing a waiver, but only under severe operational or 
personnel constraints and shall not authorize any consecutive waivers (T-0). 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/FOA/ DRU shall archive approved waivers locally, in a manner 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
25 
accessible to the representative and notify SAF/CN via saf.cnsf.mla@us.af.mil.  
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/FOA/DRU shall also provide copies to the individual’s direct supervisor 
and the individual for inclusion in their personnel file. 
4.1.8.  This manual considers the DoD Enterprise and DAF’s ongoing transition and paradigm 
shift from DoDD 8570 series policies to DoDD 8140 series policies and addresses this 
paradigm shift as follows: 
4.1.8.1.  All civilian, military, or contractor personnel who are currently filling cyber 
workforce positions as of the date of this publication have until 15 Feb 2026 to meet 
Foundational Qualifications. All personnel filling roles that are identified as belonging to 
the cybersecurity workforce element must be Foundationally Qualified not later than 15 
Feb 2025. All 8570 codes shall remain associated with the position and requirements until 
that position has been fully transitioned in accordance with paragraph 1.3 and other 
relevant provisions of this manual. 
4.1.8.2.  All personnel will continue to keep certifications and training levels in good 
standing. 
4.1.8.3.  DoD has directed all Services and components to ensure that all civilian and 
military positions are assigned DCWF codes and proficiency levels not later than 29 Feb 
2024. DCWF coding and proficiency level requirements for current or future Contactor-
filled positions have not been set as of the date of this publication. 
4.1.9.  The DAF has developed a Preferred List of cybersecurity certifications based upon the 
DoD approved cybersecurity foundational certifications. Those certifications on the DAF 
Preferred List have priority for funding. The list is maintained and posted on the CCC 
Certification and Training website at https://cwip.cce.af.mil. 
4.1.10.  To facilitate reciprocity across the DoD Enterprise, personnel may obtain or maintain 
certifications from the DoD approved cybersecurity foundational certification list as vetted by 
the CWMB. 
4.1.11.  Vouchers are only issued for initial and annual payment of vendor certification fees 
for civilian and military personnel. Issuance of any vouchers requires the individual is assigned 
to a cyber coded position. Vouchers may be requested via the CCC Certification and Training 
website: https://cwip.cce.af.mil. 
4.1.12.  CCC will pay for one exam voucher at the specified AFSC, SFSC, or DCWF 
requirement when the member does not already have a certification or have training or 
education that satisfies the foundational requirement for their primary assigned position. CCC 
will pay for additional exam vouchers from the DAF Preferred List when an individual is 
assigned additional DCWF codes that imposes additional requirements. Such allowances are 
subject to end of fiscal year budgetary constraints and may be on first-come basis after all DAF 
primary positions are served. 
4.1.13.  CCC may pay for annual vouchers for members who are cyber coded but currently 
serving in civilian development positions such as career broadening, key career positions, 
civilian development long-term training schools and civilian strategic leadership programs. 
Wherever possible, these individuals would retain their cyber codes. (T-2) To facilitate the 
return to their normal career progression, civilian personnel will maintain their qualifications 
26 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
in good standing even while serving in a joint assignment, special duty assignment, or 
deployment. 
4.1.14.  CCC funds will not be used to pay for exam vouchers for civilian or military personnel 
who are within one (1) year of a confirmed retirement or separation date (T-1). 
4.1.15.  Civilian personnel can update civilian personnel database(s) or system(s) through a 
self-certification process in the MyBiz+ application. The status of the certification would be 
listed as "self-certified" in the member's record. The member routinely receives an automated 
email with a link to upload the certificate into the AF Personnel Services application where it 
is verified by AFPC at Joint Base San Antonio -Randolph, TX. Once verified, the status in 
MyBiz+ would change to “Verified.” MyBiz+ is available on the DCPDS portal: 
https://compo.dcpds.cpms.osd.mil/. 
4.1.16.  Military personnel (officers and enlisted) will complete DAF Form 2096, 
Classification/On-the-Job Training Action, to indicate award of the SEI for the highest 
cyberspace qualification obtained (T-1). 
4.1.16.1.  The DAF Form 2096 shall be submitted within 10 working days after vendor 
notification of completing the DoD approved cyberspace certification. Members shall 
submit this form to the appropriate servicing personnel function (e.g., Force Support 
Squadron, Military Personnel Flight, or equivalent) to update their personnel record, after 
the supervisor and commander signs the form. 
4.1.16.2.  The SEI reflects coding for assigned UMD billet, position, AFSC or SFSC and/or 
DCWF requirement. 
4.1.17.  Cyberspace coding is based upon serving in an identified Cyber role and not as a 
function of rank, position of prestige, or appointment. 
4.1.18.  Graduates of Undergraduate Cyber Training are expected to become cyber coded and 
meet qualification requirements as a precondition for matriculation (entry) into the career field 
(T-1). 
4.1.18.1.  Once assigned to cyberspace-coded position, Cyber Operations (17XX) officers 
will meet DCWF foundational requirements within nine (9) months of duty assignment 
(T-0). 
4.1.18.2.  Once DCWF qualifications are obtained, 17X officers will maintain their 
qualifications in good standing even while serving in a joint assignment, special duty 
assignment, or deployment (T-1). 
4.1.19.  An individual’s cyberspace certification may be accepted for credit at the Community 
College of the Air Force, based on applicable degree requirements. It is recommended for 
individuals contact their local education office to verify applicability. 
4.2.  Exceptional Procedures 
4.2.1.  DAF Civilian and military personnel may temporarily perform cyberspace position 
duties while working toward meeting qualification requirements under the direct observation 
and supervision of a qualified individual. The responsible AO, with a recommendation from 
the ISSM must determine the allowable period. If such observation is not feasible, the 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
27 
observational requirement may be waived due to severe operational or personnel constraints, 
otherwise the individual must be reassigned duties consistent with their qualifications (T-1). 
4.2.2.  Deployment line remarks may be established for each DCWF code and proficiency level 
of cyberspace qualifications to allow the Combatant Commanders the flexibility to identify the 
appropriate cyberspace workforce requirements in a deployed environment not already 
identified in the Unit Type Code (UTC) Manpower Details section and/or to facilitate 
reciprocity across the DoD Enterprise. 
4.2.3.  Each military member assigned or tasked as a UTC substitute will meet the 
cybersecurity certification requirements where the Mission Capability Statement or manpower 
detail SEI includes cybersecurity responsibilities (T-1). 
4.3.  Waivers to procedure 
4.3.1.  Units will initiate a waiver from normal procedures, as appropriate, by consulting their 
appointed representative as noted in paragraph 2.9.6 of this manual. After vetting the request, 
representatives shall endorse the request with rationale and forward to the responsible 
Authorizing Official for their consideration if within the scope of the Authorizing Official’s 
authority. Requests requiring higher authority are considered and endorsed with SAF/CN and 
as appropriate, forwarded to the CWMB for final approval. 
4.3.2.  Cybersecurity is critical for ensuring information is protected and the Systems meets 
the operational requirements as designed under any cyber situation. Select DAF workforce 
personnel (e.g., aircrew, maintenance, researchers, and system technicians) may need limited 
elevated permissions to perform tasks as required by DAF publications (e.g., technical orders, 
aids, software handbooks, checklists, and contractor-developed technical manual procedures) 
to facilitate operation, troubleshooting and repair of systems. Limited elevated permissions are 
elevated network rights for a specific requirement as required by DAF publications but do not 
include all permissions of a privileged user. These tasks potentially require DCWF 
qualifications beyond the requirements established in publications such as mission design 
series documents and technical orders. These DAF publications have been vetted and approved 
by the responsible AO under previous models to prevent the unauthorized alteration of a 
system cybersecurity posture. Such approvals should be newly reviewed for applicability by 
relevant responsible parties. The responsible AO shall make a DCWF identification and 
requirements determination, exempting individuals who have limited elevated network or 
system permissions to systems. The determination must apply only to systems under the AO’s 
authority and responsibility for risk acceptance (T-1). The PM will initiate the exemption 
determination memo, the ISSM will coordinate on the memo and the AO will sign the memo 
(T-1). The PM will ensure the exemption determination memo includes the following items: 
4.3.2.1.  General description of specific systems. 
4.3.2.2.  Details on specific positions, including AFSC, SFSCs, or occupational series to 
be exempted. 
4.3.2.3.  Rationale why a DoD approved cyberspace foundational qualification is not 
required. 
4.3.2.4.  Details on specific actions to be performed by an individual or individuals as 
required by DAF publications that necessitate limited elevated permissions. 
28 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
4.3.2.5.  Details on security risk mitigations implemented to enable limited permissions. 
Relevant details include reference info (e.g., hyperlinks, pointers, nomenclature) for DAF 
publications (e.g., Technical Orders, aids, software handbooks, checklists, and contractor-
developed technical manual procedures). 
4.3.2.6.  Statements indicating the AO has vetted and accepted risk as described in DAF 
publications. 
4.3.2.7.  Statements describing process on how exempted personnel are vetted initially and 
annually. 
4.3.2.8.  Details on the specialized training and recurrence of exempted individuals (e.g., 
personnel must be recertified every “X” months on checklist procedures by 7-level 
evaluator or technician). 
4.3.2.9.  Statements indicating exempted individuals sign a user agreement stipulating the 
authorized actions or procedures to be performed. 
4.3.2.10.  The PMO or functional system owner will maintain the exemption memo and 
forward a copy of the signed memo to the DAF CISO for the affected Systems. 
4.3.2.11.  Exempted individuals must be classified as "Authorized Users" on the approved 
network or system account request form (e.g., DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access 
Request (SAAR)). 
4.3.2.12.  The PMO or unit must complete and document in memo format an annual 
validation, occurring on anniversary date of exemption approval that includes identifying 
information of all exempted personnel and Systems. The ISSM will sign the memo and 
route to the AO for approval. The PMOs and units must maintain and track validation 
memos locally and forward a copy of the signed validation letter to the DAF CISO via 
SAF/CN. 
4.4.  Failure to meet or maintain qualifications 
4.4.1.  Civilian and military personnel may be subject to administrative action if they do not 
obtain or maintain foundational requirements within nine months of assignment to a DCWF 
coded role, meet residential requirements within 12 months of assignment to DCWF coded 
role, or maintain their qualified status by meeting continuing education requirements. 
4.4.1.1.  During the 8570 to 8140 transition period, incumbent members are expected to 
maintain DAF funded certifications by meeting continuing education requirements and 
requesting and submitting their voucher for annual fees, unless officially notified that the 
certification will not be required for any of their DCWF coded role and their role is in 
progress to transition to DCWF in that fiscal year. 
4.4.1.2.  Waivers may be obtained pursuant to applicable provisions and procedures as 
outlined in this manual. 
4.4.1.3.  Maintenance of self-funded certifications are recommended but not required, but 
if the civilian or military member has maintained a self-funded certification and it fulfills 
the foundational requirements for their new DCWF coded role, a reimbursement can be 
made subject to end of fiscal year funding allowances. This provision expires at the end of 
FY24. 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
29 
4.4.2.  CCC will not pay for any re-testing required after an initial exam failure or 
decertification for civilian or military personnel, except where re-testing was conducted at 
initial skills training (IST) or schoolhouses. The individual will be responsible for paying to 
re-test, however PMOs or units may fund with internal resources for a re-testing at their 
discretion. SAF/CN may direct exceptions on a case-by-case basis, in coordination with 
AF/A2/6 or SF/COO, as appropriate. 
4.4.3.  Privileged access shall be removed for any personnel who does not have or maintain 
qualifications in active and good standing after the transition date. 
4.4.4.  Civilian personnel that have not obtained foundational qualifications commensurate 
with their DCWF coded position within nine months of assignment or have not obtained 
residential qualifications within 12 months of assignment may not perform any cyberspace 
tasks unless under the direct supervision of a cyberspace qualified individual. (T-1). The 
commander determines appropriate actions in accordance with local civilian personnel 
policies. 
4.4.4.1.  The commander shall immediately contact the servicing civilian personnel section 
and follow local administrative procedures regarding the individual’s primary duties, 
DCWF role, or both. 
4.4.4.2.  Remaining cyberspace tasks must be reassigned to another individual who has the 
appropriate qualification in good standing. The commander has the discretion to allow 
individuals to resume additional tasks once that individual obtains the appropriate 
qualification(s) (T-3). 
4.4.5.  Military members that have not obtained foundational qualifications commensurate 
with their DCWF coded position within nine months of assignment or has not obtained 
residential qualifications within 12 months of assignment may not perform any cyberspace 
tasks unless under the direct supervision of a cyberspace qualified individual. 
4.4.5.1.  Commanders may place military members in remedial training (e.g., CBT, hands-
on training or instructor-led training) during this time. Military members with 
demonstrated capacity for good study habits may be approved for a curriculum of self-
study. 
4.4.5.2.  If the military member is not incumbent to the position the commander shall meet 
with both the supervisor and military member to reassess whether the individual possesses 
the necessary skills to perform in the cyberspace position. This assessment should include 
but is not limited to contextual factors of the individual’s aptitude, motivation, experience, 
and knowledge level to perform at the required proficiency level in the cyberspace position. 
Commanders should exercise restraint from using this section as the basis for 
administrative or punitive action against the member when reasonableness in making the 
assignment could have prevented failure. 
4.4.5.3.  Commanders shall begin AFSC or SFSC disqualification actions in accordance 
with AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification after second test failure 
where a certification is indicated to meet foundational qualification for matriculation into 
an AFSC or SFSC and it has not been met within the time period prescribed (T-1). 
30 
DAFMAN17-1305  7 JUNE 2024 
4.4.5.3.1.  Waivers are not appropriate for granting time extensions due to examination 
failure. 
4.4.5.3.2.  If required certification is not attained or maintained, applicable SEI codes 
must be removed from the individual’s military personnel records (T-1). 
4.4.5.3.3.  Commanders of PMOs or units have the discretion to retain the individual 
or pursue other appropriate administrative actions. 
4.4.5.3.4.  If the military member is retained, supervisors shall validate the member’s
