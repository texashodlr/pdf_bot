My fellow Americans:
 e American people elected me to make America great again. I promised that my Administration would 
put the safe , interests, and well-being of our citizens Ô¨Å rst. I pledged that we would revitalize the American 
economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty, and advance our values. 
During my first year in office, you have witnessed my America First foreign policy in action. We are 
prioritizing the interests of our citizens and protecting our sovereign rights as a nation. America is 
leading again on the world stage. We are not hiding from the challenges we face. We are confronting 
them head-on and pursuing opportunities to promote the securi  and prosperi  of all Americans. 
 e United States faces an extraordinarily dangerous world, Ô¨Å lled with a wide range of threats that have 
intensified in recent years. When I came into office, rogue regimes were developing nuclear weapons 
and missiles to threaten the entire planet. Radical Islamist terror groups were Ô¨Ç ourishing. Terrorists had 
taken control of vast swaths of the Middle East. Rival powers were aggressively undermining American 
interests around the globe. At home, porous borders and unenforced immigration laws had created a host 
of vulnerabilities. Criminal cartels were bringing drugs and danger into our communities. Unfair trade 
practices had weakened our economy and exported our jobs overseas. Unfair burden-sharing with our allies 
and inadequate investment in our own defense had invited danger from those who wish us harm. Too many 
Americans had lost trust in our government, faith in our future, and confidence in our values.
Nearly one year later, although serious challenges remain, we are charting a new and very di erent course.
We are rallying the world against the rogue regime in North Korea and confronting the danger posed 
by the dictatorship in Iran, which those determined to pursue a flawed nuclear deal had neglected. We 
have renewed our friendships in the Middle East and partnered with regional leaders to help drive out 
terrorists and extremists, cut off their financing, and discredit their wicked ideology. We crushed 
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorists on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, and will continue 
pursuing them until they are destroyed. America‚Äôs allies are now contributing more to our common 
defense, strengthening even our strongest alliances. We have also continued to make clear that the United 
States will no longer tolerate economic aggression or unfair trading practices.
At home, we have restored confidence in America‚Äôs purpose. We have recommitted ourselves to 
our founding principles and to the values that have made our families, communities, and society so 
successful. Jobs are coming back and our economy is growing. We are making historic investments in 
the United States military. We are enforcing our borders, building trade relationships based on fairness 
and reciprocity, and defending America‚Äôs sovereignty without apology.

The whole world is lifted by America‚Äôs renewal and the reemergence of American leadership. After one 
year, the world knows that America is prosperous, America is secure, and America is strong. We will bring 
about the be er future we seek for our people and the world, by confronting the challenges and dangers 
posed by those who seek to destabilize the world and threaten America‚Äôs people and interests. 
My Administration‚Äôs National Security Strategy lays out a strategic vision for protecting the American 
people and preserving our way of life, promoting our prosperity, preserving peace through strength, 
and advancing American influence in the world. We will pursue this beautiful vision‚Äîa world
of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, each with its own cultures and dreams, thriving side-
by-side in prosperity, freedom, and peace‚Äîthroughout the upcoming year. 
In pursuit of that future, we will look at the world with clear eyes and fresh thinking. We will promote 
a balance of power that favors the United States, our allies, and our partners. We will never lose sight of 
our values and their capacity to inspire, uplift, and renew. 
Most of all, we will serve the American people and uphold their right to a government that prioritizes 
their security, their prosperity, and their interests. This National Security Strategy puts America First.

An America that is safe, prosperous, and free at home is an America with the 
strength, conÔ¨Å dence, and will to lead abroad. It is an America that can pre-
serve peace, uphold liber , and create enduring advantages for the American 
people. Pu ing America Ô¨Å rst is the du  of our government and the foun-
dation for U.S. leadership in the world.
A strong America is in the vital interests of not only the American people, but 
also those around the world who want to partner with the United States in 
pursuit of shared interests, values, and aspirations.
 is National Securi  Strategy puts America Ô¨Å rst. 
A
n America First National Security 
Strategy is based on American prin-
ciples, a clear-eyed assessment of U.S. 
interests, and a determination to tackle the chal-
lenges that we face. It is a strategy of principled 
realism that is guided by outcomes, not ideology. 
It is based upon the view that peace, securi , and 
prosperity depend on strong, sovereign nations 
that respect their citizens at home and cooper-
ate to advance peace abroad. And it is grounded 
in the realization that American principles are
a lasting force for good in the world.
‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù is America‚Äôs source of strength. 
 e United States was born of a desire for life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness‚Äîand a convic-
tion that unaccountable political power is tyr-
anny. For these reasons, our Founders crafted and 
ratified the Constitution, establishing the repub-
lican form of government we enjoy today. The 
Constitution grants our national government not
only specified powers necessary to protect our 
God-given rights and liberties but also safeguards 
them by limiting the government‚Äôs size and scope, 
separating Federal powers, and protecting the
rights of individuals through the rule of law. All 
political power is ultimately delegated from, and 
accountable to, the people.
We protect American sovereignty by defending 
these institutions, traditions, and principles that 
have allowed us to live in freedom, to build the nation 
that we love. And we prize our national heritage, for 
the rare and fragile institutions of republican gov-
ernment can only endure if they are sustained by a
culture that cherishes those institutions.
Liber  and independence have given us the Ô¨Ç our-
ishing society Americans enjoy today‚Äîa vibrant 
and confident Nation, welcoming of disagree-
ment and differences, but united by the bonds 
of history, culture, beliefs, and principles that 
define who we are. 
We are proud of our roots and honor the wisdom of 
the past. We are commi ed to protecting the rights 
and digni  of every citizen. And we are a nation of 
laws, because the rule of law is the shield that pro-
tects the individual from government corruption 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
2
and abuse of power, allows families to live with-
out fear, and permits markets to thrive.
Our founding principles have made the United 
States of America among the greatest forces for 
good in history. But we are also aware that we 
must protect and build upon our accomplish-
ments, always conscious of the fact that the inter-
ests of the American people constitute our true 
North Star. 
America‚Äôs achievements and standing in the world 
were neither inevitable nor accidental. On many
occasions, Americans have had to compete with
adversarial forces to preserve and advance our 
security, prosperity, and the principles we hold 
dear. At home, we fought the Civil War to end slav-
ery and preserve our Union in the long strug-
gle to extend equal rights for all Americans. In 
the course of the bloodiest century in human his-
tory, millions of Americans fought, and hun-
dreds of thousands lost their lives, to defend lib-
er  in two World Wars and the Cold War. America, 
with our  allies and partners, defeated fascism, 
imperialism, and Soviet communism and elimi-
nated any doubts about the power and durability 
of republican democracy when it is sustained by 
a free, proud, and unified people. 
The United States consolidated its military 
victories with political and economic triumphs 
built on market economies and fair trade, dem-
ocratic principles, and shared security partner-
ships. American political, business, and military
leaders worked together with their counterparts 
in Europe and Asia to shape the post-war order 
through the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and 
other institutions designed to advance our shared 
interests of securi, freedom, and peace. We recog-
nize the invaluable advantages that our strong rela-
tionships with allies and partners deliver. 
Following the remarkable victory of free nations in 
the Cold War, America emerged as the lone super-
power with enormous advantages and momen-
tum in the world. Success, however, bred com-
placency. A belief emerged, among many, that 
American power would be unchallenged and self‚Äì
sustaining. The United States began to drift. We 
experienced a crisis of confidence and surren-
dered our advantages in key areas. As we took 
our political, economic, and military advan-
tages for granted, other actors steadily imple-
mented their long-term plans to challenge America 
and to advance agendas opposed to the United 
States, our allies, and our partners. 
We stood by while countries exploited the interna-
tional institutions we helped to build.  ey subsi-
dized their industries, forced technology transfers, 
and distorted markets. These and other actions 
challenged America‚Äôs economic securi . At home, 
excessive regulations and high taxes stiÔ¨Ç ed growth 
and weakened free enterprise‚Äîhistory‚Äôs great-
est antidote to poverty. Each time government 
encroached on the productive activities of private 
commerce, it threatened not only our prosperity 
but also the spirit of creation and innovation that 
has been key to our national greatness.
A Competitive World
The United States will respond to the growing
political, economic, and military competitions we 
face around the world. 
China and Russia challenge American power, inÔ¨Ç u-
ence, and interests, a empting to erode American 
security and prosperity. They are determined to 
make economies less free and less fair, to grow 
their militaries, and to control information and
data to repress their societies and expand their 
influence. At the same time, the dictatorships of 
the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea and the 
Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to desta-
bilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies, 
and brutalize their own people. Transnational 
3
I N T R O D U C T I O N
threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transna-
tional criminal organizations, are actively trying 
to harm Americans. While these challenges dif-
fer in nature and magnitude, they are fundamen-
tally contests between those who value human 
dignity and freedom and those who oppress 
individuals and enforce uniformity.
These competitions require the United States 
to rethink the policies of the past two decades‚Äîpoli-
cies based on the assumption that engagement with 
rivals and their inclusion in international insti-
tutions and global commerce would turn them 
into benign actors and trustworthy partners. For 
the most part, this premise turned out to be false. 
Rival actors use propaganda and other means to try
to discredit democracy.  ey advance anti-Western 
views and spread false information to create divi-
sions among ourselves, our allies, and our partners. 
In addition, jihadist terrorists such as ISIS and 
al-Qa‚Äôida continue to spread a barbaric ideology 
that calls for the violent destruction of governments
and innocents they consider to be apostates.  ese 
jihadist terrorists attempt to force those under 
their influence to submit to Sharia law.
America‚Äôs military remains the strongest in the
world. However, U.S. advantages are shrinking 
as rival states modernize and build up their con-
ventional and nuclear forces. Many actors can 
now field a broad arsenal of advanced missiles, 
including variants that can reach the American 
homeland. Access to technology empowers and 
emboldens otherwise weak states. North Korea‚Äîa 
country that starves its own people‚Äîhas spent
hundreds of millions of dollars on nuclear, chem-
ical, and biological weapons that could threaten 
our homeland. In addition, many actors have 
become skilled at operating below the thresh-
old of military conflict‚Äîchallenging the United 
States, our allies, and our partners with hostile
actions cloaked in deniabili . Our task is to ensure 
that American military superiority endures, and 
in combination with other elements of national
power, is ready to protect Americans against 
sophisticated challenges to national security. 
The contest over information accelerates these 
political, economic, and military competitions.
Data, like energy, will shape U.S. economic prosper-
ity and our future strategic position in the world. 
The ability to harness the power of data is fun-
damental to the continuing growth of America‚Äôs 
economy, prevailing against hostile ideologies, 
and building and deploying the most effective 
military in the world. 
We learned the di  cult lesson that when America 
does not lead, malign actors Ô¨Å ll the void to the dis-
advantage of the United States. When America 
does lead, however, from a position of strength
and conÔ¨Å dence and in accordance with our inter-
ests and values, all beneÔ¨Å t. 
Competition does not always mean hostility, nor 
does it inevitably lead to conflictalthough none
should doubt our commitment to defend our inter-
ests. An America that successfully competes is the 
best way to prevent conÔ¨Ç ict. Just as American weak-
ness invites challenge, American strength and con-
fidence deters war and promotes peace. 
An America First 
National Securi  Strategy 
The competitions and rivalries facing the United 
States are not passing trends or momentary prob-
lems. They are intertwined, long-term challenges 
that demand our sustained national a ention and 
commitment. 
America possesses unmatched political, eco-
nomic, military, and technological advantages. 
But to maintain these advantages, build upon our 
strengths, and unleash the talents of the American 
people, we must protect four vital national inter-
ests in this competitive world.
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
4
First, our fundamental responsibility is to 
protect the American people, the homeland,
and the American way of life. We will strengthen
control of our borders and reform our immigra-
tion system. We will protect our critical infrastruc-
ture and go after malicious cyber actors. A layered 
missile defense system will defend our homeland 
against missile a acks. And we will pursue threats 
to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are 
stopped before they ever reach our borders. 
Second, we will promote American prosperity. 
We will rejuvenate the American economy for 
the benefit of American workers and companies. 
We will insist upon fair and reciprocal economic 
relationships to address trade imbalances. The 
United States must preserve our lead in research 
and technology and protect our economy from 
competitors who unfairly acquire our intellec-
tual property. And we will embrace America‚Äôs 
energy dominance because unleashing abundant 
energy resources stimulates our economy. 
Third, we will preserve peace through strength 
by rebuilding our military so that it remains pre-
eminent, deters our adversaries, and if necessary, 
is able to fight and win. We will compete with all 
tools of national power to ensure that regions of
the world are not dominated by one power. We 
will strengthen America‚Äôs capabilities‚Äîinclud-
ing in space and cyberspace‚Äîand revitalize oth-
ers that have been neglected. Allies and partners 
magnify our power. We expect them to shoul-
der a fair share of the burden of responsibil-
ity to protect against common threats.
Fourth, we will advance American influence 
because a world that supports American inter-
ests and reflects our values makes America more 
secure and prosperous. We will compete and lead 
in multilateral organizations so that American 
interests and principles are protected. America‚Äôs 
commitment to liber , democracy, and the rule of 
law serves as an inspiration for those living under 
 ranny. We can play a catalytic role in promoting 
private-sector-led economic growth, helping aspir-
ing partners become future trading and security 
partners. And we will remain a generous nation,
even as we expect others to share responsibili .
Strengthening our sovereignty‚Äîthe first duty of 
a government is to serve the interests of its own 
people‚Äîis a necessary condition for protecting 
these four national interests. And as we strengthen 
our sovereignty we will renew confidence in our-
selves as a nation. We are proud of our history, 
optimistic about America‚Äôs future, and confident 
of the positive example the United States o ers to 
the world. We are also realistic and understand 
that the American way of life cannot be imposed 
upon others, nor is it the inevitable culmination 
of progress. Together with our allies, partners, 
and aspiring partners, the United States will pur-
sue cooperation with reciprocity. Cooperation 
means sharing responsibilities and burdens. 
In trade, fair and reciprocal relationships ben-
efit all with equal levels of market access and 
opportunities for economic growth. An America
First National Security Strategy appreciates that 
America will catalyze conditions to unleash eco-
nomic success for America and the world.
In the United States, free men and women have 
created the most just and prosperous nation in 
history. Our generation of Americans is now 
charged with preserving and defending that 
precious inheritance. This National Security 
Strategy shows the way.

T
his National Security Strategy begins 
with the determination to protect the
American people, the American way
of life, and American interests. Americans have 
long recognized the beneÔ¨Å ts of an interconnected 
world, where information and commerce flow 
freely. Engaging with the world, however, does 
not mean the United States should abandon its 
rights and duties as a sovereign state or compro-
mise its security. Openness also imposes costs, 
since adversaries exploit our free and demo-
cratic system to harm the United States. 
North Korea seeks the capabili  to kill millions of 
Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports 
terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruc-
tion. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS 
and al-Qa‚Äôida are determined to a ack the United 
States and radicalize Americans with their hate-
ful ideology. Non-state actors undermine social 
order through drug and human trafficking net-
works, which they use to commit violent crimes 
and kill thousands of American each year.
Adversaries target sources of American strength, 
including our democratic system and our econ-
omy. They steal and exploit our intellectual prop-
erty and personal data, interfere in our political 
processes, target our aviation and maritime sec-
tors, and hold our critical infrastructure at risk. 
All of these actions threaten the foundations of 
the American way of life. Reestablishing lawful 
control of our borders is a first step toward pro-
tecting the American homeland and strengthen-
ing American sovereignty.
We must prevent nuclear, chemical, radiological, 
and biological a acks, block terrorists from reach-
ing our homeland, reduce drug and human traf-
ficking, and protect our critical infrastructure. 
We must also deter, disrupt, and defeat poten-
tial threats before they reach the United States. 
We will target jihadist terrorists and transna-
tional criminal organizations at their source and 
dismantle their networks of support.
We must also take steps to respond quickly to meet 
the needs of the American people in the event of 
natural disaster or attack on our homeland. We 
must build a culture of preparedness and resilience 
across our governmental functions, critical infra-
structure, and economic and political systems. 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y

Secure U.S. Borders 
and Territory
State and non-state actors place the safety of the 
American people and the Nation‚Äôs economic 
vitality at risk by exploiting vulnerabilities 
across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyber-
space domains. Adversaries constantly evolve 
their methods to threaten the United States and 
our citizens. We must be agile and adaptable.
Defend Against Weapons 
of Mass Destruction (WMD)
 e danger from hostile state and non-state actors 
who are trying to acquire nuclear, chemical, radio-
logical, and biological weapons is 
increasing. The Syrian regime‚Äôs 
use of chemical weapons against 
its own citizens undermines 
international norms against 
these heinous weapons, which
may encourage more actors to 
pursue and use them. ISIS has 
used chemical weapons in Iraq 
and Syria. Terrorist groups con-
tinue to pursue WMD-related 
materials. We would face grave 
danger if terrorists obtained 
inadequately secured nuclear,
radiological, or biological material. 
As missiles grow in numbers, types, and effec-
tiveness, to include those with greater ranges, 
they are the most likely means for states like 
North Korea to use a nuclear weapon against
the United States. North Korea is also pursuing 
chemical and biological weapons which could 
also be delivered by missile. China and Russia
are developing advanced weapons and capabil-
ities that could threaten our critical infrastruc-
ture and our command and control architecture.
Priori  Actions
ENHANCE MISSILE DEFENSE: The United States
is deploying a layered missile defense system 
focused on North Korea and Iran to defend our 
homeland against missile attacks. This system 
will include the ability to defeat missile threats 
prior to launch. Enhanced missile defense is
not intended to undermine strategic stabil-
ity or disrupt longstanding strategic relation-
ships with Russia or China.
DETECT AND DISRUPT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION: 
At our borders and within our territory, we will 
bolster efforts to detect nuclear, chemical, radio-
logical, and biological agents and keep them from 
being used against us. We will also better inte-
grate intelligence, law enforce-
ment, and emergency manage-
ment operations to ensure that 
frontline defenders have the 
right information and capabili-
ties to respond to WMD threats 
from state and non-state actors.
ENHANCE COUNTERPROLIFERATION
MEASURES: Building on decades
of initiatives, we will aug-
ment measures to secure, 
eliminate, and prevent the
spread of WMD and related 
materials, their delivery sys-
tems, technologies, and knowledge to reduce
the chance that they might fall into the hands 
of hostile actors. We will hold state and non-
state actors accountable for the use of WMD. 
TARGET WMD TERRORISTS: We will direct coun-
terterrorism operations against terrorist WMD
specialists, Ô¨Å nanciers, administrators, and facilita-
tors. We will work with allies and partners to detect 
and disrupt plots.
Strengthening control 
over our borders and 
immigration system is 
central to national securi , 
economic prosperi , and 
the rule of law.

Combat Biothreats and Pandemics 
Biological incidents have the potential to cause 
catastrophic loss of life. Biological threats to the 
U.S. homeland‚Äîwhether as the result of deliberate 
a ack, accident, or a natural outbreak‚Äîare growing 
and require actions to address them at their source.
Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such as 
Ebola and SARS, as well as the deliberate 2001
anthrax attacks in the United States, demon-
strated the impact of biological threats on national 
security by taking lives, generating economic 
losses, and contributing to a loss of confidence in 
government institutions.
Advancements in life sciences that benefit our 
health, economy, and socie  also open up new ave-
nues to actors who want to cause harm. Dedicated 
state actors are likely to develop more advanced 
bioweapons, and these capabilities may become
available to malicious non-state actors as well. 
Priori  Actions 
DETECT AND CONTAIN BIOTHREATS AT THEIR SOURCE: 
We will work with other countries to detect 
and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the 
spread of disease. We will encourage other coun-
tries to invest in basic health care systems and 
to strengthen global health security across the 
intersection of human and animal health to pre-
vent infectious disease outbreaks. And we will 
work with partners to ensure that laboratories 
that handle dangerous pathogens have in place 
safety and security measures.
SUPPORT BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: We will protect
and support advancements in biomedical inno-
vation by strengthening the intellectual prop-
erty system that is the foundation of the biomedi-
cal industry.
IMPROVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE: At home, we will 
strengthen our emergency response and uni-
fied coordination systems to rapidly character-
ize outbreaks, implement public health contain-
ment measures to limit the spread of disease, 
and provide surge medical care‚Äîincluding 
life-saving treatments. 
Strengthen Border Control 
and Immigration Policy 
Strengthening control over our borders and 
immigration system is central to national secu-
rity, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. 
Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal car-
tels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S.
security and public safety. These actors adapt 
quickly to outpace our defenses. 
The United States affirms our sovereign right to 
determine who should enter our country and
under what circumstances. The United States 
understands the contributions immigrants have 
made to our Nation throughout its history. Illegal 
immigration, however, burdens the economy, 
hurts American workers, presents public safety 
risks, and enriches smugglers and other criminals. 
 e United States recognizes that decisions about 
who to legally admit for residency, citizenship, or 
otherwise are among the most important a coun-
try has to make. The United States will continue 
to welcome lawful immigrants who do not pose 
a security threat and whose entry is consistent 
with the national interest, while at the same time 
enhancing the screening and vetting of travelers, 
closing dangerous loopholes, revising outdated 
laws, and eliminating easily exploited vulnera-
bilities. We will also reform our current immi-
gration system, which, contrary to our national 
interest and national securi , allows for random-
ized entry and extended-family chain migration. 
Residency and citizenship determinations should 
be based on individuals‚Äô merits and their ability
to positively contribute to U.S. socie , rather than 
chance or extended family connections.

Priori  Actions
ENHANCE BORDER SECURITY: We will secure our
borders through the construction of a bor-
der wall, the use of multilayered defenses and 
advanced technology, the employment of addi-
tional personnel, and other measures. The U.S. 
Government will work with foreign partners to 
deter, detect, and disrupt suspicious individuals 
well before they enter the United States.
ENHANCE VETTING: The U.S. Government will 
enhance vetting of prospective immigrants, ref-
ugees, and other foreign visitors to identify indi-
viduals who might pose a risk to national secu-
rity or public safety. We will set higher security 
standards to ensure that we keep dangerous peo-
ple out of the United States and enhance our 
information collection and analysis to identify 
those who may already be within our borders. 
ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS: We will enforce 
immigration laws, both at the border and in the 
interior, to provide an e ective deterrent to illegal 
immigration.  e apprehension and swift removal 
of illegal aliens at the border is critical to an e ective 
border security strategy. We must also increase 
efforts to identify and counter fraud in the immi-
gration process, which undermines the integrity 
of our immigration system, exploits vulnerable 
individuals, and creates national security risks. 
BOLSTER TR ANSPORTATION SECURIT Y: We will 
improve information sharing across our gov-
ernment and with foreign partners to enhance 
the security of the pathways through which peo-
ple and goods enter the country. We will invest in 
technology to counter emerging threats to our avi-
ation, surface, and maritime transportation sec-
tors. We will also work with international and
industry partners to raise security standards.
Pursue  reats 
to  eir Source
There is no perfect defense against the range of 
threats facing our homeland. That is why America 
must, alongside allies and partners, stay on the 
offensive against those violent non-state groups 
that target the United States and our allies.
 e primary transnational threats Americans face 
are from jihadist terrorists and transnational crim-
inal organizations. Although their objectives di er, 
these actors pose some common challenges. First, 
they exploit our open society. Second, they often 
operate in loose confederations and adapt rapidly. 
 ird, they rely on encrypted communication and 
the dark web to evade detection as they plot, recruit, 
Ô¨Å nance, and execute their operations. Fourth, they 
thrive under conditions of state weakness and prey
on the vulnerable as they accelerate the break-
down of rules to create havens from which to plan 
and launch a acks on the United States, our allies, 
and our partners. Fifth, some are sheltered and 
supported by states and do their bidding.
Defeat Jihadist Terrorists
Jihadist terrorist organizations present the most 
dangerous terrorist threat to the Nation. America, 
alongside our allies and partners, is Ô¨Å ghting a long 
war against these fanatics who advance a totali-
tarian vision for a global Islamist caliphate that 
justifies murder and slavery, promotes repres-
sion, and seeks to undermine the American way 
of life. Jihadist terrorists use virtual and physical 
networks around the world to radicalize isolated 
individuals, exploit vulnerable populations, and 
inspire and direct plots.
Even after the territorial defeat of ISIS and al-Qa‚Äôida 
in Syria and Iraq, the threat from jihadist terror-
ists will persist.  ey have used ba leÔ¨Å elds as test 
beds of terror and have exported tools and tactics
to their followers. Many of these jihadist terror-

ists are likely to return to their home countries, 
from which they can continue to plot and launch 
a acks on the United States and our allies. 
The United States also works with allies and
partners to deter and dis-
rupt other foreign terror-
ist groups that threaten 
t h e  h o m e l a n d ‚Äî i n c l u d -
ing Iranian-backed groups 
such as Lebanese Hizballah. 
Priori  Actions 
DISRUPT TERROR PLOTS: We will
enhance intelligence shar-
ing domestically and with for-
eign partners. We will give 
our frontline defenders‚Äî
including homeland secu-
rity, law enforcement, and intelligence profes-
sionals‚Äîthe tools, authorities, and resources to 
stop terrorist acts before they take place. 
TAKE DIRECT ACTION: The U.S. military and other 
operating agencies will take direct action against 
terrorist networks and pursue terrorists who 
threaten the homeland and U.S. citizens regard-
less of where they are.  e campaigns against ISIS 
and al-Qa‚Äôida and their a  liates demonstrate that 
the United States will enable partners and sus-
tain direct action campaigns to destroy terrorists 
and their sources of support, making it harder for 
them to plot against us.
ELIMINATE TERRORIST SAFE HAVENS: Time and ter-
ritory allow jihadist terrorists to plot, so we will 
act against sanctuaries and prevent their reemer-
gence, before they can threaten the U.S. home-
land. We will go after their digital networks and 
work with private industry to confront the chal-
lenge of terrorists and criminals ‚Äúgoing dark‚Äù and 
using secure platforms to evade detection.
SEVER SOURCES OF STRENGTH: We will disrupt the 
Ô¨Å nancial, materiel, and personnel supply chains of 
terrorist organizations. We will sever their Ô¨Å nanc-
ing and protect the U.S. and international Ô¨Å nancial 
systems from abuse. We will degrade their abili  
to message and attract poten-
tial recruits. This includes 
combating the evil ideology 
of jihadists by exposing its 
falsehoods, promoting count-
er-narratives, and amplify-
ing credible voices.
SHARE RESPONSIBILIT Y: Our 
allies and partners, who are 
also targets of terrorism, will 
continue to share responsi-
bility in fighting these bar-
baric groups. We will help our
partners develop and respon-
sibly employ the capacity to 
degrade and maintain persistent pressure against 
terrorists and will encourage partners to work 
independently of U.S. assistance. 
COMBAT RADICALIZATION AND RECRUITMENT IN
COMMUNITIES: The United States rejects bigotry
and oppression and seeks a future built on our val-
ues as one American people. We will deny vio-
lent ideologies the space to take root by improving 
trust among law enforcement, the private sector,
and American citizens. U.S. intelligence and home-
land security experts will work with law enforce-
ment and civic leaders on terrorism prevention and 
provide accurate and actionable information about 
radicalization in their communities. 
Dismantle Transnational 
Criminal Organizations 
The United States must devote greater resources 
to dismantle transnational criminal organiza-

day they deliver drugs to American communities, 
fuel gang violence, and engage in cybercrime.  e 
illicit opioid epidemic, fed by drug cartels as well 
as Chinese fentanyl traffickers, kills tens of thou-
sands of Americans each year.  ese organizations 
weaken our allies and partners too, by corrupting 
and undermining democratic institutions. TCOs 
are motivated by proÔ¨Å t, power, and political inÔ¨Ç u-
ence. They exploit weak governance and enable 
other national security threats, including terror-
ist organizations. In addition, some state adver-
saries use TCOs as instruments of national power,
offering them territorial sanctuary where they 
are free to conduct unattributable cyber intru-
sions, sabotage, theft, and political subversion.
Priori  Actions 
IMPROVE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND INTELLIGENCE: 
We will establish national-level strategic intelli-
gence and planning capabilities
to improve the ability of agen-
cies to work together to combat 
TCOs at home and abroad.
DEFEND COMMUNITIES: We will 
deny TCOs the ability to harm 
Americans. We will support 
public health efforts to halt the
growth of illicit drug use in the 
United States, expand national 
and community-based preven-
tion efforts, increase access to 
evidenced-based treatment for 
addiction, improve prescrip-
tion drug monitoring, and provide training on 
substance use disorders for medical personnel. 
DEFEND IN DEPTH: U.S. agencies and foreign 
partners will target TCO leaders and their sup-
port infrastructure. We will assist countries, par-
ticularly in the Western Hemisphere, to break
the power of these organizations and networks. 
COUNTER CYBER CRIMINALS: We will use sophisti-
cated investigative tools to disrupt the ability of 
criminals to use online marketplaces, crypto-
currencies, and other tools for illicit activities. 
 e United States will hold countries accountable 
for harboring these criminals. 
Keep America Safe 
in the Cyber Era
America‚Äôs response to the challenges and oppor-
tunities of the cyber era will determine our future 
prosperi  and securi . For most of our history, the 
United States has been able to protect the home-
land by controlling its land, air, space, and mari-
time domains. Today, cyberspace offers state and 
non-state actors the ability to wage campaigns 
against American political, economic, and secu-
rity interests without ever physically crossing 
our borders. Cyberattacks offer adversaries low-
cost and deniable opportunities
to seriously damage or disrupt 
critical infrastructure, cripple 
American businesses, weaken 
our Federal networks, and
attack the tools and devices that
Americans use every day to com-
municate and conduct business. 
Critical infrastructure keeps our 
food fresh, our houses warm,
our trade flowing, and our cit-
izens productive and safe. The
vulnerability of U.S. critical 
infrastructure to cyber, phys-
ical, and electromagnetic attacks means that 
adversaries could disrupt military command and 
control, banking and Ô¨Å nancial operations, the elec-
trical grid, and means of communication. 
Federal networks also face threats.  ese networks 
allow government agencies to carry out vital func-
tions and provide services to the American peo-
America‚Äôs response 
to the challenges and 
opportunities of the cyber 
era will determine 
our future prosperi

ple. The government must do a better job of pro-
tecting data to safeguard information and the 
privacy of the American people. Our Federal net-
works must be modernized and updated. 
In addition, the daily lives of most Americans rely 
on computer-driven and interconnected technolo-
gies. As our reliance on computers and connectiv-
ity increases, we become increasingly vulnerable
to cyberattacks. Businesses and individuals must
be able to operate securely in cyberspace.
Security was not a major consideration when the 
Internet was designed and launched. As it evolves, 
the government and private sector must design
systems that incorporate prevention, protec-
tion, and resiliency from the start, not as an after-
thought. We must do so in a way that respects free 
markets, private competition, and the limited but 
important role of government in enforcing the 
rule of law. As we build the next generation of dig-
ital infrastructure, we have an opportuni  to put 
our experience into practice. 
The Internet is an American invention, and it 
should reflect our values as it continues to trans-
form the future for all nations and all genera-
tions. A strong, defensible cyber infrastructure 
fosters economic growth, protects our liberties, 
and advances our national security. 
Priori  Actions 
IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE RISK: To improve the secu-
rity and resilience of our critical infrastruc-
ture, we will assess risk across six key areas: 
national securi , energy and power, banking and 
finance, health and safety, communications, and 
transportation. We will assess where cyberat-
tacks could have catastrophic or cascading con-
sequences and prioritize our protective efforts, 
capabilities, and defenses accordingly. 
BUILD DEFENSIBLE GOVERNMENT NETWORKS: We will 
use the latest commercial capabilities, shared ser-
vices, and best practices to modernize our Federal 
information technology. We will improve our abil-
i  to provide uninterrupted and secure communi-
cations and services under all conditions. 
DETER AND DISRUPT MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS: 
The Federal Government will ensure that those 
charged with securing critical infrastructure have 
the necessary authorities, information, and capa-
bilities to prevent attacks before they affect or 
hold at risk U.S. critical infrastructure.  e United 
States will impose swift and costly consequences 
on foreign governments, criminals, and other 
actors who undertake signiÔ¨Å cant malicious cyber 
activities. We will work with allies and friends to 
expand our awareness of malicious activities. A 
stronger and more resilient critical infrastructure 
will strengthen deterrence by creating doubt in our 
adversaries that they can achieve their objectives. 
IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING AND SENSING:
The U.S. Government will work with our critical 
infrastructure partners to assess their informa-
tional needs and to reduce the barriers to informa-
tion sharing, such as speed and classification lev-
els. We will also invest in capabilities that improve 
the ability of the United States to attribute cyber-
a acks. In accordance with the protection of civil 
liberties and privacy, the U.S. Government will 
expand collaboration with the private sector so that 
we can be er detect and a ribute a acks. 
DEPLOY LAYERED DEFENSES: Since threats transit 
globally, passing through communications back-
bones without challenge, the U.S. Government will 
work with the private sector to remediate known 
bad activities at the network level to improve 
the security of all customers. Malicious activ-
ity must be defeated within a network and not be 
passed on to its destination whenever possible.

Promote American
Resilience 
Despite our best efforts, our government cannot
prevent all dangers to the American people. We 
can, however, help Americans remain resilient in 
the face of adversity. Resilience includes the abil-
ity to withstand and recover rapidly from delib-
erate attacks, accidents, natural disasters, as well 
as unconventional stresses, shocks, and threats 
to our economy and democratic system. In the
event of a disaster, Federal, state, and local agen-
cies must perform essential functions and have 
plans in place to ensure the continuation of our 
constitutional form of government. 
Reducing risk and building more resilient com-
munities are the best ways to protect people, prop-
erty, and taxpayer dollars from loss and disrup-
tion. Through risk-informed investments, we will 
build resilient communities and infrastructure 
to protect and beneÔ¨Å t future generations.
Should tragedy strike, the U.S. Government will 
help communities recover and rebuild. Citizens 
must be conÔ¨Å dent in our government, but also rec-
ognize that response and recovery begins with 
individuals and local communities. In difficult 
times, the true character of the American peo-
ple emerges: their strength, their love, and their 
resolve. Our Ô¨Å rst responders selÔ¨Ç essly run toward 
danger, and volunteers rally to the aid of neigh-
bors when disaster strikes. 
A democracy is only as resilient as its people. An 
informed and engaged citizenry is the fundamen-
tal requirement for a free and resilient nation. For 
generations, our society has protected free press, 
free speech, and free thought. Today, actors such 
as Russia are using information tools in an a empt 
to undermine the legitimacy of democracies. 
Adversaries target media, political processes, Ô¨Å nan-
cial networks, and personal data. The American 
public and private sectors must recognize this and 
work together to defend our way of life. No exter-
nal threat can be allowed to shake our shared 
commitment to our values, undermine our sys-
tem of government, or divide our Nation.
Priori  Actions 
IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT: The United States will 
improve its ability to assess the threats and haz-
ards that pose the greatest risks to Americans 
and will prioritize resources based on the high-
est risks. 
BUILD A CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS: This Admin-
istration will take steps to build a culture of pre-
paredness, informing and empowering commu-
nities and individuals to obtain the skills and 
take the preparatory actions necessary to become 
more resilient against the threats and hazards 
that Americans face.
IMPROVE PLANNING: State and local governments 
must conduct realistic exercises that test exist-
ing plans to make sure that they are sound and 
can be executed. Agencies from all levels of gov-
ernment must coordinate be er and apply lessons 
learned from exercises to pinpoint the areas and 
capabilities that require improvement. 
INCENTIVIZE INFORMATION SHARING: To improve the 
coordination among the private sector and all lev-
els of government that is needed to improve resil-
ience, we must make a stronger commitment to 
protecting sensitive information so that all part-
ners actively identify and share vulnerabilities 
and work collaboratively to reduce them.

A 
strong economy protects the American 
people, supports our way of life, and sus-
tains American power. American work-
ers thrive when they are free to innovate, develop 
and access our abundant natural resources, and 
operate in markets free from excessive regula-
tions and unfair foreign trade practices. A grow-
ing and innovative economy allows the United 
States to maintain the world‚Äôs most powerful mili-
tary and protect our homeland.
We must rebuild our economic strength and 
restore confidence in the American economic 
model. Over decades, American factories, com-
panies, and jobs moved overseas. After the 2008 
global Ô¨Å nancial crisis, doubt replaced conÔ¨Å dence.
Risk-aversion and regulations replaced investment 
and entrepreneurship.  e recovery produced ane-
mic growth in real earnings for American workers. 
 e U.S. trade deÔ¨Å cit grew as a result of several fac-
tors, including unfair trading practices. 
For 70 years, the United States has embraced a 
strategy premised on the belief that leadership 
of a stable international economic system rooted 
in American principles of reciprocity, free mar-
kets, and free trade served our economic and 
security interests. Working with our allies and 
partners, the United States led the creation of 
a group of financial institutions and other eco-
nomic forums that established equitable rules 
and built instruments to stabilize the interna-
tional economy and remove the points of friction 
that had contributed to two world wars.
That economic system continues to serve our
interests, but it must be reformed to help American 
workers prosper, protect our innovation, 
and reflect the principles upon which that sys-
tem was founded. Trading partners and inter-
national institutions can do more to address 
trade imbalances and adhere to and enforce the 
rules of the order.
Today, American prosperity and security are 
challenged by an economic competition play-
ing out in a broader strategic context. The United 
States helped expand the liberal economic trad-
ing system to countries that did not share our val-
ues, in the hopes that these states would liber-
alize their economic and political practices and 
provide commensurate benefits to the United 
States. Experience shows that these countries dis-
torted and undermined key economic institu-
tions without undertaking significant reform of 
their economies or politics.  ey espouse free trade 
rhetoric and exploit its benefits, but only adhere 
selectively to the rules and agreements.
We welcome all economic relationships rooted in 
fairness, reciproci , and faithful adherence to the 
rules.  ose who join this pursuit will be our clos-
est economic partners. But the United States will
no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, 
or economic aggression. We must work with like-
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y

minded allies and partners to ensure our princi-
ples prevail and the rules are enforced so that our 
economies prosper. 
The United States will pursue 
an economic strategy that reju-
venates the domestic economy, 
benefits the American worker, 
revitalizes the U.S. manufactur-
ing base, creates middle-class 
jobs, encourages innovation, pre-
serves technological advantage, 
safeguards the environment, 
and achieves energy dominance. 
Rebuilding economic strength 
at home and preserving a fair 
and reciprocal international 
economic system will enhance 
our security and advance pros-
perity and peace in the world.
Rejuvenate the 
Domestic Economy
Economic challenges at home demand that we 
understand economic prosperity as a pillar of 
national security. Despite low unemployment 
rates and stock market gains, overall economic 
growth has, until recently, been anemic since 
the 2008 recession. In the past five years, gross 
domestic product (GDP) growth hovered barely 
above two percent, and wages stagnated. Taxes
increased, and health insurance and prescrip-
tion drug costs continued to rise, albeit at a slower 
pace. Education costs climbed at rates far above 
inflation, increasing student debt. Productivity 
growth fell to levels not seen in decades. 
SigniÔ¨Å cant government intrusion in the economy 
slowed growth and job creation. Regulatory and 
corporate tax policies incentivized businesses to 
invest overseas and disadvantaged American com-
panies against foreign competitors. Excessive reg-
ulation burdened small businesses. Banking regu-
lations squelched new bank formation and caused 
hundreds of small banks to close. Regulation 
decreased credit availability to 
consumers and decreased prod-
uct choice. Excessive environ-
mental and infrastructure reg-
ulations impeded American
energy trade and the devel-
opment of new infrastruc-
ture projects. 
Moreover, the poor state of our 
physical infrastructure stulti-
fied the economy, reduced the 
profitability of American small 
businesses, and slowed the pro-
ductivity of American workers. 
America‚Äôs digital infrastructure 
also fell behind. Improvements 
in bandwidth, better broadband connectiv-
ity, and protection from persistent cyberattacks 
are needed to support America‚Äôs future growth.
Economic and personal transactions are depen-
dent upon the ‚Äú.com world,‚Äù and wealth creation 
depends on a reliable, secure Internet. 
The Administration is dedicated to rejuvenat-
ing the U.S. economy, unleashing the potential of 
all Americans, and restoring confidence in our 
free market system. Promoting American pros-
perity makes America more secure and advances 
American inÔ¨Ç uence in the world.
Priori  Actions 
REDUCE REGULATORY BURDENS: Departments and
agencies will eliminate unnecessary regulations 
that stiÔ¨Ç e growth, drive up costs for American busi-
nesses, impede research and development, dis-
courage hiring, and incentivize domestic busi-
nesses to move overseas. We will balance our 
reduction in regulations with adequate protec-
tions and oversight. 
Rebuilding economic 
strength at home and 
preserving a fair and

PROMOTE TAX REFORM: This Administration will 
work with the Congress to create a simpler, fairer, 
and pro-growth tax code that encourages the 
creation of higher wage jobs and gives middle-
income families tax relief. Reduced business 
tax rates and a territorial system for foreign sub-
sidiary earnings will improve the competitive-
ness of American companies and encourage their
return to the United States. 
IMPROVE AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE: Federal, state,
and local governments will work together with pri-
vate industry to improve our airports, seaports 
and waterways, roads and railways, transit sys-
tems, and telecommunications.  e United States 
will use our strategic advantage as a leading natu-

manufacturing. We will improve America‚Äôs digital
infrastructure by deploying a secure 5G Internet 
capability nationwide. These improvements will 
increase national competitiveness, beneÔ¨Å t the envi-

REDUCE THE DEBT THROUGH FISCAL 
RESPONSIBILITY: The national 
debt, now over $20 trillion, pres-
ents a grave threat to America‚Äôs 
long-term prosperity and, by 
extension, our national securi . 
By restraining Federal spending, 
making government more effi-

Promote Free, Fair, 
and Reciprocal Economic 
Relationships
For decades, the United States has allowed unfair 
trading practices to grow. Other countries have 
used dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barri-
ers, forced technology transfers, non-economic 
capacity, industrial subsidies, and other support 
from governments and state-owned enterprises to 
gain economic advantages. 
Today we must meet the challenge. We will address 
persistent trade imbalances, break down trade 
barriers, and provide Americans new opportuni-
ties to increase their exports. The United States 
will expand trade that is fairer so that U.S. work-
ers and industries have more opportunities to 
compete for business. We oppose closed mercan-
tilist trading blocks. By strengthening the inter-
national trading system and incentivizing other
countries to embrace mar-
ket-friendly policies, we can 
enhance our prosperi .
 e United States distinguishes 
between economic competition
with countries that follow fair

ADOPT NEW TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS 
AND MODERNIZE EXISTING ONES: The United States 
will pursue bilateral trade and investment agree-

ments to ensure they are consistent with those 
principles. Agreements must adhere to high stan-
dards in intellectual property, digital trade, agri-

COUNTER UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES: The United 
States will counter all unfair trade practices that 
distort markets using all appropriate means, 
from dialogue to enforcement tools. 
COUNTER FOREIGN CORRUPTION: Using our eco-
nomic and diplomatic tools, the United States will 
continue to target corrupt foreign officials and 
work with countries to improve their ability to 
fight corruption so U.S. companies can compete 
fairly in transparent business climates. 
WORK WITH LIKE-MINDED PARTNERS: The United 
States will work with like-minded partners to pre-

fair trade enforcement actions when necessary, as 
well as multinational efforts to ensure transpar-

tunities and increase the market base for U.S. 
goods and services.
Lead in Research, Technology, 
Invention, and Innovation
The United States will build on the ingenuity 
that has launched industries, created jobs, and 
improved the quality of life at home and abroad. 
To maintain our competitive advantage, the 
United States will prioritize emerging technolo-
gies critical to economic growth and securi , such 
as data science, encryption, autonomous tech-
nologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotech-
nology, advanced computing technologies, and 
artificial intelligence. From self-driving cars to 
autonomous weapons, the Ô¨Å eld of artiÔ¨Å cial intelli-
gence, in particular, is progressing rapidly. 
 e United States must continue to a ract the inno-
vative and the inventive, the brilliant and the bold. 
We will encourage scientists in government, aca-
demia, and the private sector to achieve advance-
ments across the full spectrum of discovery, from 
incremental improvements to game-changing 
breakthroughs. We will nurture a healthy inno-
vation economy that collaborates with allies and
partners, improves STEM education, draws on an 
advanced technical workforce, and invests in ear-
ly-stage research and development (R&D). 
Priori  Actions
U NDE RSTAND WORLDWIDE SCIE NCE AND TECH -
NOLOGY (S&T) TRENDS: To retain U.S. advantages 
over our competitors, U.S. Government agencies
must improve their understanding of worldwide 
S&T trends and how they are likely to influence‚Äî
or undermine‚ÄîAmerican strategies and programs. 
ATTRACT AND RETAIN INVENTORS AND INNOVATORS: 
The U.S. Government must improve our collab-
oration with industry and academia and our 
recruitment of technical talent. We will remove 
barriers to the full use of talent across Federal 
agencies, and increase incentives for hiring and 
retaining Federal STEM employees. Initiatives 
21
P I L L A R  I I :  P R O M O T E  A M E R I C A N  P R O S P E R I T Y
will include rapid hiring, swift adjudication of 
national security clearances, and offers of com-
petitive salaries. We must create easier paths 
for the flow of scientists, engineers, and technol-
ogists into and out of public service. 
LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL AND EXPERTISE TO BUILD 
AND INNOVATE: The U.S. Government will use pri-
vate sector technical expertise and R&D capabili-
ties more e ectively. Private industry owns many 
of the technologies that the government relies
upon for critical national security missions. The 
Department of Defense and other agencies will 
establish strategic partnerships with U.S. compa-
nies to help align private sector R&D resources to 
priority national security applications. 
RAPIDLY FIELD INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS: The 
United States must regain the element of surprise 
and field new technologies at the pace of mod-
ern industry. Government agencies must shift 
from an archaic R&D process to an approach that 
rewards rapid fielding and risk taking. 
Promote and Protect 
the U.S. National Securi  
Innovation Base
America‚Äôs business climate and legal and regu-
latory systems encourage risk taking. We are a 
nation of people who work hard, dream big, and 
never give up. Not every country shares these
characteristics. Some instead steal or illicitly 
acquire America‚Äôs hard-earned intellectual prop-
erty and proprietary information to compensate 
for their own systemic weaknesses. 
Every year, competitors such as China steal U.S. 
intellectual property valued at hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. Stealing proprietary technol-
ogy and early-stage ideas allows competitors to 
unfairly tap into the innovation of free societ-
ies. Over the years, rivals have used sophisticated 
means to weaken our businesses and our econ-
omy as facets of cyber-enabled economic war-
fare and other malicious activities. In addition to 
these illegal means, some actors use largely legit-
imate, legal transfers and relationships to gain 
access to fields, experts, and trusted foundries 
that fill their capability gaps and erode America‚Äôs 
long-term competitive advantages. 
We must defend our National Securi  Innovation 
Base (NSIB) against competitors. The NSIB is 
the American network of knowledge, capabili-
ties, and people‚Äîincluding academia, National 
Laboratories, and the private sector‚Äîthat turns 
ideas into innovations, transforms discoveries 
into successful commercial products and com-
panies, and protects and enhances the American
way of life.  e genius of creative Americans, and 
the free system that enables them, is critical to 
American security and prosperity. 
Protecting the NSIB requires a domestic and inter-
national response beyond the scope of any indi-
vidual company, industry, university, or govern-
ment agency. The landscape of innovation does 
not divide neatly into sectors. Technologies that 
are part of most weapon systems often originate 
in diverse businesses as well as in universities and 
colleges. Losing our innovation and technologi-
cal edge would have far-reaching negative implica-
tions for American prosperi  and power. 
Priori  Actions 
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES:  e U.S. Government 
will develop a capabili  to integrate, monitor, and 
better understand the national security implica-
tions of unfair industry trends and the actions of 
our rivals. We will explore new ways to share this 
information with the private sector and academia 
so they be er understand their responsibilities in
curtailing activities that undercut America‚Äôs NSIB. 
PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:  e United States 
will reduce the illicit appropriation of U.S. pub-
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y

lic and private sector technology and technical
knowledge by hostile foreign competitors. While 
maintaining an investor-friendly climate, this 
Administration will work with the Congress to 
strengthen the Commi ee on Foreign Investment 
in the United States (CFIUS) to ensure it addresses 
current and future national
securi  risks.  e United States 
will prioritize counterintel-
ligence and law enforcement 
activities to curtail intellectual 
property theft by all sources 
and will explore new legal and 
regulatory mechanisms to pre-
vent and prosecute violations. 
T I G H T E N  V I S A  P R O C E D U R E S : 
The United States will review 
visa procedures to reduce economic theft by 
non-traditional intelligence collectors. We will 
consider restrictions on foreign STEM stu-
dents from designated countries to ensure 
that intellectual property is not transferred 
to our competitors, while acknowledging the 
importance of recruiting the most advanced tech-
nical workforce to the United States.
PROTECT DATA AND UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE:
The United States will expand our focus beyond 
protecting networks to protecting the data on 
those networks so that it remains secure‚Äîboth at 
rest and in transit. To do this, the U.S. Government 
will encourage practices across companies 
and universities to defeat espionage and theft. 
Embrace Energy Dominance
For the Ô¨Å rst time in generations, the United States 
will be an energy-dominant nation. Energy dom-
inance‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs central position in the global 
energy system as a leading producer, consumer, and
innovator‚Äîensures that markets are free and U.S. 
infrastructure is resilient and secure. It ensures 
that access to energy is diversiÔ¨Å ed, and recognizes 
the importance of environmental stewardship. 
Access to domestic sources of clean, affordable,
and reliable energy underpins a prosperous, 
secure, and powerful America for decades to come. 
Unleashing these abundant 
energy resources‚Äîcoal, natural 
gas, petroleum, renewables, and 
nuclear‚Äîstimulates the econ-
omy and builds a foundation for 
future growth. Our Nation must 
take advantage of our wealth in 
domestic resources and energy 
efficiency to promote competi-
tiveness across our industries. 
The United States also anchors 
the North American energy sys-
tem, which is one of the most highly integrated in 
the world. Our vibrant cross-border energy trade 
and investment are vital for a robust and resilient
U.S. economy and energy market. We are com-
mitted to supporting energy initiatives that will 
attract investments, safeguard the environment, 
strengthen our energy security, and unlock the 
enormous potential of our shared region. 
Climate policies will continue to shape the global 
energy system. U.S. leadership is indispensable 
to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that 
is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy secu-
ri  interests. Given future global energy demand, 
much of the developing world will require fossil 
fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their 
economies and lift their people out of pover .  e 
United States will continue to advance an approach 
that balances energy security, economic develop-
ment, and environmental protection. The United
States will remain a global leader in reducing tradi-
tional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while 
expanding our economy.  is achievement, which 
can serve as a model to other countries, Ô¨Ç ows from 
innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy 
efficiency gains, not from onerous regulation.
For the Ô¨Å rst time in 
generations, the United 
States will be an energy-
dominant nation. 
23
P I L L A R  I I :  P R O M O T E  A M E R I C A N  P R O S P E R I T Y
As a growing supplier of energy resources, technol-
ogies, and services around the world, the United 
States will help our allies and partners become 
more resilient against those that use energy to 
coerce. America‚Äôs role as an energy exporter will
also require an assessment of our vulnerabilities 
and a resilient American infrastructure.
Finally, the Nation‚Äôs long-term energy security 
future rests with our people. We must invest in our 
future by supporting innovation and R&D, includ-
ing through the National Laboratories.
Priori  Actions
REDUCE BARRIERS:  e United States will promote 
clean and safe development of our energy resources, 
while limiting regulatory burdens that encum-
ber energy production and constrain economic 
growth. We will streamline the Federal regula-
tory approval processes for energy infrastructure, 
from pipeline and export terminals to container 
shipments and gathering lines, while also ensuring 
responsible environmental stewardship. 
PROMOTE EXPORTS: The United States will pro-
mote exports of our energy resources, technolo-
gies, and services, which helps our allies and part-
ners diversify their energy sources and brings 
economic gains back home. We will expand our 
export capaci  through the continued support of 
private sector development of coastal terminals, 
allowing increased market access and a greater
competitive edge for U.S. industries. 
ENSURE ENERGY SECURITY: The United States will 
work with allies and partners to protect global 
energy infrastructure from cyber and physical 
threats. The United States will support the diver-
sification of energy sources, supplies, and routes 
at home and abroad. We will modernize our stra-
tegic petroleum stocks and encourage other 
countries to develop their own‚Äîconsistent with 
their national energy security needs.
ATTAIN UNIVERSAL ENERGY ACCESS: The United 
States will seek to ensure universal access to
affordable, reliable energy, including highly effi-
cient fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, to 
help reduce poverty, foster economic growth, 
and promote prosperity. 
FURTHER AMERICA‚ÄôS TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE: We will
improve America‚Äôs technological edge in energy, 
including nuclear technology, next-generation 
nuclear reactors, better batteries, advanced com-
puting, carbon-capture technologies, and opportu-
nities at the energy-water nexus.  e United States 
will continue to lead in innovative and efficient 
energy technologies, recognizing the economic
and environmental beneÔ¨Å ts to end users.

A 
central continuity in history is the con-
test for power. The present time period
is no different. Three main sets of chal-
lengers‚Äîthe revisionist powers of China and 
Russia, the rogue states of Iran and North Korea, 
and transnational threat organizations, particu-
larly jihadist terrorist groups‚Äîare actively com-
peting against the United States and our allies 
and partners. Although differing in nature and 
magnitude, these rivals compete across politi-
cal, economic, and military arenas, and use tech-
nology and information to accelerate these con-
tests in order to shift regional balances of power 
in their favor. These are fundamentally political 
contests between those who favor repressive sys-
tems and those who favor free societies. 
China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical 
to U.S. values and interests. China seeks to displace 
the United States in the Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c region, expand 
the reaches of its state-driven economic model, 
and reorder the region in its favor. Russia seeks to 
restore its great power status and establish spheres 
of influence near its borders. The intentions of 
both nations are not necessarily Ô¨Å xed.  e United 
States stands ready to cooperate across areas of
mutual interest with both countries.
For decades, U.S. policy was rooted in the belief 
that support for China‚Äôs rise and for its integra-
tion into the post-war international order would 
liberalize China. Contrary to our hopes, China 
expanded its power at the expense of the sov-
ereignty of others. China gathers and exploits 
data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features 
of its authoritarian system, including corrup-
tion and the use of surveillance. It is building the 
most capable and well-funded military in the 
world, after our own. Its nuclear arsenal is grow-
ing and diversi ing. Part of China‚Äôs military mod-
ernization and economic expansion is due to its 
access to the U.S. innovation economy, includ-
ing America‚Äôs world-class universities.
Russia aims to weaken U.S. inÔ¨Ç uence in the world 
and divide us from our allies and partners. Russia 
views the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and European Union (EU) as threats. Russia 
is investing in new military capabilities, includ-
ing nuclear systems that remain the most signifi-
cant existential threat to the United States, and in 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
26
destabilizing cyber capabilities.  rough modern-
ized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes 
in the domestic political a airs of countries around 
the world. The combination of Russian ambition 
and growing military capabilities creates an unsta-
ble frontier in Eurasia, where the risk of conflict 
due to Russian miscalculation is growing. 
 e scourge of the world today is a small group of 
rogue regimes that violate all principles of free 
and civilized states. The Iranian regime spon-
sors terrorism around the world. It is developing 
more capable ballistic missiles and has the poten-
tial to resume its work on nuclear weapons that 
could threaten the United States and our part-
ners. North Korea is ruled as a ruthless dictator-
ship without regard for human dignity. For more 
than 25 years, it has pursued nuclear weapons 
and ballistic missiles in deÔ¨Å ance of every commit-
ment it has made. Today, these missiles and weap-
ons threaten the United States and our allies.  e
longer we ignore threats from countries deter-
mined to proliferate and develop weapons of mass 
destruction, the worse such threats become, and 
the fewer defensive options we have. 
The United States continues to wage a long war 
against jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS and
al-Qa‚Äôida. These groups are linked by a common 
radical Islamist ideology that encourages vio-
lence against the United States and our partners 
and produces misery for those under their control. 
Although the United States and our partners have 
inÔ¨Ç icted defeats on ISIS and al-Qa‚Äôida in Syria and 
Iraq, these organizations maintain global reach 
with established branches in strategic locations. 
The threat from jihadist terrorists will persist,
even as we intensify efforts to prevent attacks on 
Americans, our allies, and our partners. 
Protecting American interests requires that we 
compete continuously within and across these 
contests, which are being played out in regions 
around the world. The outcome of these con-
tests will influence the political, economic, and 
military strength of the United States and our 
allies and partners.
To prevail, we must integrate all elements of 
America‚Äôs national power‚Äîpolitical, economic, and 
military. Our allies and partners must also con-
tribute the capabilities, and demonstrate the will, 
to confront shared threats. Experience suggests 
that the willingness of rivals to abandon or forgo 
aggression depends on their perception of U.S.
strength and the vitali  of our alliances. 
The United States will seek areas of cooperation
with competitors from a position of strength, fore-
most by ensuring our military power is second 
to none and fully integrated with our allies and 
all of our instruments of power. A strong mili-
tary ensures that our diplomats are able to oper-
ate from a position of strength. In this way we can, 
together with our allies and partners, deter and if 
necessary, defeat aggression against U.S. interests 
and increase the likelihood of managing competi-
tions without violent conÔ¨Ç ict and preserving peace.
Renew America‚Äôs 
Competitive Advantages
The United States must consider what is endur-
ing about the problems we face, and what is new. 
The contests over influence are timeless. They 
have existed in varying degrees and levels of inten-
sity, for millennia. Geopolitics is the interplay of 
these contests across the globe. But some condi-
tions are new, and have changed how these com-
petitions are unfolding. We face simultaneous 
threats from different actors across multiple are-
nas‚Äîall accelerated by technology. The United 
States must develop new concepts and capabili-
ties to protect our homeland, advance our pros-
peri , and preserve peace. 
27
Since the 1990s, the United States displayed a great 
degree of strategic complacency. We assumed that 
our military superiori  was guaranteed and that 
a democratic peace was inevitable. We believed 
that liberal-democratic enlargement and inclu-
sion would fundamentally alter 
the nature of international rela-
tions and that competition would 
give way to peaceful cooperation. 
I n stead of bu i ld i ng m i l i-
tary capacity, as threats to our 
national security increased, 
the United States dramatically 
cut the size of our military to
the lowest levels since 1940. 
Instead of developing import-
ant capabilities, the Joint Force 
entered a nearly decade long 
‚Äúprocurement holiday‚Äù during 
which the acquisition of new
weapon systems was severely 
limited. The breakdown of the 
Nation‚Äôs annual Federal budgeting process, exem-
plified by sequestration and repeated continu-
ing resolutions, further contributed to the ero-
sion of America‚Äôs military dominance during a 
time of increasing threats.
Despite decades of efforts to reform the way that 
the United States develops and procures new weap-
ons, our acquisition system remained sclerotic. 
The Joint Force did not keep pace with emerg-
ing threats or technologies. We got less for our 
defense dollars, shortchanging American tax-
payers and warÔ¨Å ghters. 
We also incorrectly believed that technology could 
compensate for our reduced capaci ‚Äîfor the abil-
i  to Ô¨Å eld enough forces to prevail militarily, con-
solidate our gains, and achieve our desired polit-
ical ends. We convinced ourselves that all wars 
would be fought and won quickly, from stand-off 
distances and with minimal casualties. 
In addition, after being dismissed as a phenom-
enon of an earlier century, great power competi-
tion returned. China and Russia began to reassert
their inÔ¨Ç uence regionally and globally. Today, they 
are Ô¨Å elding military capabilities designed to deny 
America access in times of cri-
sis and to contest our ability to 
operate freely in critical com-
mercial zones during peacetime. 
In short, they are contesting our
geopolitical advantages and try-
ing to change the international 
order in their favor.
Moreover, deterrence today 
is significantly more com-
plex to achieve than during the 
Cold War. Adversaries stud-
ied the American way of war 
and began investing in capabil-
ities that targeted our strengths 
and sought to exploit perceived 
weaknesses. The spread of accu-
rate and inexpensive weap-
ons and the use of cyber tools have allowed state 
and non-state competitors to harm the United
States across various domains. Such capabili-
ties contest what was until recently U.S. domi-
nance across the land, air, maritime, space, and 
cyberspace domains. They also enable adversar-
ies to a empt strategic a acks against the United 
States‚Äîwithout resorting to nuclear weapons‚Äîin 
ways that could cripple our economy and our abil-
i  to deploy our military forces. Deterrence must 
be extended across all of these domains and must
address all possible strategic attacks. 
In addition, adversaries and competitors became 
adept at operating below the threshold of open 
military conflict and at the edges of interna-
tional law. Repressive, closed states and orga-
nizations, although brittle in many ways, are 
often more agile and faster at integrating eco-
nomic, military, and especially informational

 e United States will seek 
areas of cooperation with 
competitors from a position 
of strength, foremost by

our allies and all of our

means to achieve their goals. They are unencum-
bered by truth, by the rules and protections of pri-
vacy inherent in democracies, and by the law of
armed conflict. They employ sophisticated politi-
cal, economic, and military campaigns that com-
bine discrete actions. They are patient and con-
tent to accrue strategic gains over time‚Äîmaking 
it harder for the United States and our allies to 
respond. Such actions are calculated to achieve 
maximum effect without provoking a direct mil-
itary response from the United States. And as 
these incremental gains are realized, over time, 
a new status quo emerges. 
 e United States must prepare for this  pe of com-
petition. China, Russia, and other state and non-
state actors recognize that the United States often
views the world in binary terms, with states being 
either ‚Äúat peace‚Äù or ‚Äúat war,‚Äù when it is actually an 
arena of continuous competition. Our adversar-
ies will not Ô¨Å ght us on our terms. We will raise our 
competitive game to meet that challenge, to pro-
tect American interests, and to advance our values. 
Our diplomatic, intelligence, military, and eco-
nomic agencies have not kept pace with the changes 
in the character of competition. America‚Äôs mili-
tary must be prepared to operate across a full spec-
trum of conÔ¨Ç ict, across multiple domains at once. 
To meet these challenges we must also upgrade 
our political and economic instruments to operate 
across these environments. 
Bureaucratic inertia is powerful. But so is the tal-
ent, creativity, and dedication of Americans. By 
aligning our public and private sector efforts we 
can field a Joint Force that is unmatched. New 
advances in computing, autonomy, and manufac-
turing are already transforming the way we Ô¨Å ght. 
When coupled with the strength of our allies and 
partners, this advantage grows. The future that 
we face is ours to win or lose. History suggests 
that Americans will rise to the occasion and that 
we can shift trends back in favor of the United 
States, our allies, and our partners. 
Renew Capabilities
Given the new features of the geopolitical envi-
ronment, the United States must renew key capa-
bilities to address the challenges we face. 
Military
U.S. military strength remains a vital compo-
nent of the competition for influence. The Joint 
Force demonstrates U.S. resolve and commit-
ment and provides us with the ability to fight 
and win across any plausible conflict that threat-
ens U.S. vital interests. 
The United States must retain overmatch‚Äî
the combination of capabilities in sufficient
scale to prevent enemy success and to ensure 
that America‚Äôs sons and daughters will never 
be in a fair fight. Overmatch strengthens our 
diplomacy and permits us to shape the inter-
national environment to protect our interests. 
To retain military overmatch the United States 
must restore our ability to produce innovative 
capabilities, restore the readiness of our forces for 
major war, and grow the size of the force so that it 
is capable of operating at sufficient scale and for 
ample duration to win across a range of scenarios. 
We must convince adversaries that we can and 
will defeat them‚Äînot just punish them if they 
a ack the United States. We must ensure the abil-
ity to deter potential enemies by denial, convinc-
ing them that they cannot accomplish objectives 
through the use of force or other forms of aggres-
sion. We need our allies to do the same‚Äîto modern-
ize, acquire necessary capabilities, improve read-
iness, expand the size of their forces, and affirm 
the political will to win. 
29
Priori  Actions  
MODERNIZATION: Ensuring that the U.S. military 
can defeat our adversaries requires weapon sys-
tems that clearly overmatch theirs in lethality.
Where possible, we must improve existing systems 
to maximize returns on prior investments. In other 
areas we should seek new capa-
bilities that create clear advan-
tages for our military while
posing costly dilemmas for our
adversaries. We must elimi-
nate bureaucratic impediments 
to innovation and embrace less 
expensive and time-intensive 
commercial off-the-shelf solu-
tions. Departments and agen-
cies must work with industry to 
experiment, prototype, and rap-
idly field new capabilities that
can be easily upgraded as new 
technologies come online. 
ACQUISITION: The United States will pursue new
approaches to acquisition to make better deals 
on behalf of the American people that avoid 
cost overruns, eliminate bloated bureaucra-
cies, and stop unnecessary delays so that we can 
put the right equipment into the hands of our 
forces. We must harness innovative technolo-
gies that are being developed outside of the tradi-
tional defense industrial base. 
CAPACITY: The size of our force matters. To deter
conflict and, if deterrence fails, to win in war, 
the Nation must be able to field forces capa-
ble of operating in sufficient scale and for ample 
duration to defeat enemies, consolidate mili-
tary gains, and achieve sustainable outcomes
that protect the American people and our vital 
interests. The United States must reverse recent 
decisions to reduce the size of the Joint Force 
and grow the force while modernizing and 
ensuring readiness. 
IMPROVE READINESS:  e United States must retain 
a ready force that is capable of protecting the home-
land while defending U.S. interests. Readiness 
requires a renewed focus on training, logistics, 
and maintenance. We must be able to get to a the-
ater in time to shape events quickly. This will 
require a resilient forward posture and agile
global mobility forces. 
RETAIN A FULL-SPECTRUM FORCE:
The Joint Force must remain 
capable of deterring and defeat-
ing the full range of threats to the 
United States. The Department 
of Defense must develop new
operational concepts and capa-
bilities to win without assured 
dominance in air, maritime, 
land, space, and cyberspace 
domains, including against 
those operating below the level 
of conventional military con-
flict. We must sustain our competence in irregu-
lar warfare, which requires planning for a long-
term, rather than ad hoc, fight against terrorist 
networks and other irregular threats. 
Defense Industrial Base
A healthy defense industrial base is a critical ele-
ment of U.S. power and the National Security 
Innovation Base. The ability of the military to 
surge in response to an emergency depends on 
our Nation‚Äôs ability to produce needed parts and
systems, healthy and secure supply chains, and a 
skilled U.S. workforce. The erosion of American 
manufacturing over the last two decades, how-
ever, has had a negative impact on these capa-
bilities and threatens to undermine the ability 
of U.S. manufacturers to meet national security 
requirements. Today, we rely on single domes-
tic sources for some products and foreign supply 
chains for others, and we face the possibili  of not 
being able to produce specialized components for

the military at home. As America‚Äôs manufactur-
ing base has weakened, so too have critical work-
force skills ranging from industrial welding, to 
high-technology skills for cybersecuri  and aero-
space. Support for a vibrant domestic manufactur-
ing sector, a solid defense industrial base, and resil-
ient supply chains is a national priority.
Priori  Actions 
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: We will evaluate the 
strengths and weaknesses of our defense indus-
trial base, including the identification of materi-
als essential to national security, contingencies
that could affect supply chains, and technologies 
that are likely to be critical for the future. 
ENCOURAGE HOMELAND INVESTMENT: The United 
States will promote policies and incentives 
that return key national security industries 
to American shores. Where possible, the U.S. 
Government will work with industry partners to 
strengthen U.S. competitiveness in key technolo-
gies and manufacturing capabilities. In addition, 
we will reform regulations and processes to facili-
tate the export of U.S. military equipment.
PROTECT AND GROW CRITICAL SKILLS: The United 
States must maintain and develop skilled trades 
and high-technology skills through increased 
support for technical college and apprentice-
ship programs. We will support STEM efforts, 
at the Federal and state levels, and target national 
security technology areas. 
Nuclear Forces
Nuclear weapons have served a vital purpose in 
America‚Äôs National Security Strategy for the past 
70 years. They are the foundation of our strat-
egy to preserve peace and stability by deterring 
aggression against the United States, our allies, 
and our partners. While nuclear deterrence strat-
egies cannot prevent all conflict, they are essen-
tial to prevent nuclear a ack, non-nuclear strategic 
attacks, and large-scale conventional aggression. 
In addition, the extension of the U.S. nuclear deter-
rent to more than 30 allies and partners helps to 
assure their security, and reduces their need to 
possess their own nuclear capabilities.
Following the Cold War, the United States reduced 
investments in our nuclear enterprise and reduced 
the role of nuclear weapons in our strategy. Some 
parts of America‚Äôs strategic nuclear Triad of bomb-
ers, sea-based missiles, and land-based missiles are 
over 30 years old, and much of our nuclear infra-
structure dates to the World War II era. At the same 
time, however, nuclear-armed adversaries have
expanded their arsenals and range of delivery sys-
tems. The United States must maintain the credi-
ble deterrence and assurance capabilities provided 
by our nuclear Triad and by U.S. theater nuclear 
capabilities deployed abroad. Significant invest-
ment is needed to maintain a U.S. nuclear arsenal 
and infrastructure that is able to meet national 
securi  threats over the coming decades. 
Priori  Actions 
SUSTAIN U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS: The United States 
will sustain a nuclear force structure that meets 
our current needs and addresses unanticipated 
risks. The United States does not need to match 
the nuclear arsenals of other powers, but we must 
sustain a stockpile that can deter adversaries, 
assure allies and partners, and achieve U.S. objec-
tives if deterrence fails.
MODE RNIZE U. S . N UCLE AR FORCES AND INFR A-
STRUCTURE: We will modernize our nuclear enter-
prise to ensure that we have the scientific, engi-
neering, and manufacturing capabilities nec-
essary to retain an effective and safe nuclear
Triad and respond to future national secu-
rity threats. Modernization and sustainment 
require investing in our aging command and 
control system and maintaining and growing 
31
the highly skilled workforce needed to develop,
manufacture, and deploy nuclear weapons.
MAINTAIN STABLE DETERRENCE: To avoid miscalcu-
lation, the United States will conduct discussions 
with other states to build predictable relation-
ships and reduce nuclear risks. We will consider 
new arms control arrangements if they contribute 
to strategic stability and if they are verifiable. We 
will not allow adversaries to use threats of nuclear 
escalation or other irresponsible nuclear behav-
iors to coerce the United States, our allies, and  
our partners. Fear of escalation will not prevent
the United States from defending our vital inter-
ests and those of our allies and partners. 
Space 
The United States must maintain our leadership
and freedom of action in space. Communications 
and Ô¨Å nancial networks, military and intelligence 
systems, weather monitoring, navigation, and 
more have components in the space domain. As 
U.S. dependence on space has increased, other 
actors have gained access to space-based systems 
and information. Governments and private sector 
Ô¨Å rms have the abili  to launch satellites into space 
at increasingly lower costs.  e fusion of data from 
imagery, communications, and geolocation ser-
vices allows motivated actors to access previously 
unavailable information.  is ‚Äúdemocratization of 
space‚Äù has an impact on military operations and 
on America‚Äôs abili  to prevail in conÔ¨Ç ict. 
Many countries are purchasing satellites to sup-
port their own strategic military activities. Others 
believe that the abili  to a ack space assets o ers 
an asymmetric advantage and as a result, are pur-
suing a range of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. 
The United States considers unfettered access to 
and freedom to operate in space to be a vital inter-
est. Any harmful interference with or an attack 
upon critical components of our space archi-
tecture that directly affects this vital U.S. inter-
est will be met with a deliberate response at a 
time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.
Priori  Actions
ADVANCE SPACE AS A PRIORITY DOMAIN: America‚Äôs
newly re-established National Space Council, 
chaired by the Vice President, will review America‚Äôs 
long-range space goals and develop a strategy that 
integrates all space sectors to support innova-
tion and American leadership in space. 
PROMOTE SPACE COMMERCE: The United States will
simplify and update regulations for commer-
cial space activity to strengthen competitiveness. 
As the U.S. Government partners with U.S. com-
mercial space capabilities to improve the resil-
iency of our space architecture, we will also con-
sider extending national security protections to 
our private sector partners as needed. 
MAINTAIN LEAD IN EXPLORATION: To enable human
exploration across the solar system and to bring 
back to Earth new knowledge and opportuni-
ties, we will increase public-private partnerships 
and promote ventures beyond low Earth orbit 
with allies and friends. 
Cyberspace
Malicious state and non-state actors use cyberat-
tacks for extortion, information warfare, disinfor-
mation, and more. Such a acks have the capabili  
to harm large numbers of people and institutions 
with comparatively minimal investment and a 
troubling degree of deniability. These attacks can
undermine faith and confidence in democratic
institutions and the global economic system. 
Many countries now view cyber capabilities 
as tools for projecting influence, and some use 
cyber tools to protect and extend their autocratic 
regimes. Cyberattacks have become a key feature
of modern conflict. The United States will deter, 
P I L L A R  I I I :  P R E S E R V E  P E A C E  T H R O U G H  S T R E N G T H
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
32
defend, and when necessary defeat malicious 
actors who use cyberspace capabilities against the 
United States. When faced with the opportunity 
to take action against malicious actors in cyber-
space, the United States will be risk informed, but 
not risk averse, in considering our options.
Priori  Actions
IM PROVE AT TRIB UTION , ACCOU NTAB ILIT Y, AN D
RESPONSE: We will invest in capabilities to sup-
port and improve our ability to attribute cyber-
attacks, to allow for rapid response. 
ENHANCE CYBER TOOLS AND EXPERTISE: We will 
improve our cyber tools across the spectrum of 
conflict to protect U.S. Government assets and 
U.S. critical infrastructure, and to protect the 
integrity of data and information. U.S. depart-
ments and agencies will recruit, train, and
retain a workforce capable of operating across 
this spectrum of activity. 
I M PROVE I NTEG R ATIO N AN D AG I LIT Y: We will 
improve the integration of authorities and pro-
cedures across the U.S. Government so that 
cyber operations against adversaries can be 
conducted as required. We will work with the 
Congress to address the challenges that continue 
to hinder timely intelligence and information 
sharing, planning and operations, and the devel-
opment of necessary cyber tools. 
Intelligence 
America‚Äôs ability to identify and respond to geo-
strategic and regional shifts and their political, eco-
nomic, military, and securi  implications requires
that the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) gather, 
analyze, discern, and operationalize information. 
In this information-dominant era, the IC must con-
tinuously pursue strategic intelligence to antic-
ipate geostrategic shifts, as well as shorter-term 
intelligence so that the United States can respond 
to the actions and provocations of rivals. 
The ability of the United States to modernize 
our military forces to overmatch our adversar-
ies requires intelligence support. Intelligence is 
needed to understand and anticipate foreign doc-
trine and the intent of foreign leaders, prevent tac-
tical and operational surprise, and ensure that 
U.S. capabilities are not compromised before 
they are fielded. In addition, virtually all mod-
ern weapon systems depend upon data derived 
from scientiÔ¨Å c and technical intelligence. 
 e IC, as well as the law enforcement communi , 
offer unique abilities to defend against and miti-
gate threat actors operating below the threshold of 
open conflict. Both communities have exception-
ally strong liaison relationships throughout the 
world, allowing the United States to cooperate with 
allies and partners to protect against adversaries.
Priori  Actions 
IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING: To prevent the theft of
sensitive and proprietary information and main-
tain supply chain integri , the United States must
increase our understanding of the economic pol-
icy priorities of our adversaries and improve 
our ability to detect and defeat their attempts to 
commit economic espionage. 
HARNESS ALL INFORMATION AT OUR DISPOSAL: The 
United States will, in concert with allies and part-
ners, use the information-rich open-source envi-
ronment to deny the ability of state and non-state 
actors to attack our citizens, conduct offensive 
intelligence activities, and degrade America‚Äôs 
democratic institutions. 
FUSE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS:  e United States 
will fuse our analysis of information derived from
the diplomatic, information, military, and eco-
nomic domains to compete more effectively on 
the geopolitical stage.
33
Diplomacy and Statecraft 
Competitive Diplomacy
Across the competitive landscape, America‚Äôs dip-
lomats are our forward-deployed political capa-
bility, advancing and defending America‚Äôs inter-
ests abroad. Diplomacy catalyzes the political, 
economic, and societal connections that create 
America‚Äôs enduring alignments and that build 
positive networks of rela-
tionships with partners.
Diplomacy sustains dia-
logue and fosters areas of 
cooperation with compet-
itors. It reduces the risk of 
costly miscommunication.
Diplomacy is indispens-
able to identify and imple-
ment solut ions to con-
flicts in unstable regions 
of the world short of mili-
tary involvement. It helps to 
galvanize allies for action 
and marshal the collective 
resources of like-minded 
n at ion s a nd orga n i z a-
tions to address shared problems. Authoritarian 
states are eager to replace the United States 
where the United States withdraws our diplo-
mats and closes our outposts. 
We must upgrade our diplomatic capabili-
ties to compete in the current environment and 
to embrace a competitive mindset. Effective 
diplomacy requires the efficient use of limited 
resources, a professional diplomatic corps, modern 
and safe facilities, and secure methods to commu-
nicate and engage with local populations. 
Priori  Actions 
PRESERVE A FORWARD DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE: Our 
diplomats must be able to build and sustain rela-
tionships where U.S. interests are at stake. Face-
to-face diplomacy cannot be replaced by tech-
nology. Relationships, developed over time, 
create trust and shared understanding that the 
United States calls upon when confronting secu-
rity threats, responding to crises, and encour-
aging others to share the 
burden for tackling the 
world‚Äôs challenges. We must 
enable forward-deployed 
field work beyond the con-
fines of diplomatic facilities, 
including partnering with 
military colleagues in con-
flict-affected states.
ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS: 
In the ongoing contests 
for power, our diplomats 
must build and lead coali-
tions that advance shared 
interests and articulate 
America‚Äôs vision in interna-
tional forums, in bilateral 
relationships, and at local levels within states. 
Our diplomats need additional flexibility to oper-
ate in complex conflict-affected areas.
CATALYZE OPPORTUNITIES: Diplomats must iden-
tify opportunities for commerce and coop-
eration, and facilitate the cultural, educa-
tional, and people-to-people exchanges that 
create the networks of current and future polit-
ical, civil society, and educational leaders who 
will extend a free and prosperous world. 
P I L L A R  I I I :  P R E S E R V E  P E A C E  T H R O U G H  S T R E N G T H
Diplomacy is indispensable to 
identi  and implement solutions 
to conÔ¨Ç icts in unstable regions 
of the world short of military 
involvement. It helps to galvanize

collective resources of like-minded 
nations and organizations 
to address shared problems.

Tools of Economic Diplomacy
Retaining our position as the world‚Äôs preemi-
nent economic actor strengthens our ability to 
use the tools of economic diplomacy for the good 
of Americans and others. Maintaining America‚Äôs 
central role in international financial forums 
enhances our security and prosperity by expand-
ing a communi  of free market economies, defend-
ing against threats from state-led economies, and 
protecting the U.S. and international economy 
from abuse by illicit actors.
We want to create wealth for Americans and our
allies and partners. Prosperous states are stron-
ger security partners who are able to share the 
burden of confronting com-
mon threats. Fair and recip-
rocal trade, investments, and 
exchanges of knowledge deepen 
our alliances and partnerships, 
which are necessary to succeed 
in today‚Äôs competitive geopoliti-
cal environment. Trade, export
promotion, targeted use of for-
eign assistance, and modern-
ized development finance tools 
can promote stability, prosper-
ity, and political reform, and 
build new partnerships based 
on the principle of reciprocity.
Economic tools‚Äîincluding sanctions, anti-mon-
ey-laundering and anti-corruption measures, and 
enforcement actions‚Äîcan be important parts of 
broader strategies to deter, coerce, and constrain 
adversaries. We will work with like-minded part-
ners to build support for tools of economic diplo-
macy against shared threats. Multilateral eco-
nomic pressure is often more effective because it 
limits the ability of targeted states to circumvent 
measures and conveys united resolve.
Priori  Actions
R E I N FO R C E E CO N O M I C TI E S W IT H A L LI E S A N D
PARTNERS: We will strengthen economic ties as a 
core aspect of our relationships with like-minded 
states and use our economic expertise, mar-
kets, and resources to bolster states threatened 
by our competitors.
DEPLOY ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON SECURITY THREATS: 
We will use existing and pursue new economic 
authorities and mobilize international actors 
to increase pressure on threats to peace and 
security in order to resolve confrontations short 
of military action.
SEVER SOURCES OF FUNDING: We will deny reve-
nue to terrorists, WMD proliferators, and other 
illicit actors in order to constrain 
their ability to use and move 
funds to support hostile acts 
and operations.
Information Statecraft
America‚Äôs competitors weap-
onize information to attack the 
values and institutions that 
underpin free societies, while 
shielding themselves from out-
side information. They exploit 
marketing techniques to tar-
get individuals based upon 
their activities, interests, 
opinions, and values. They disseminate mis-
information and propaganda.
Risks to U.S. national security will grow as com-
petitors integrate information derived from per-
sonal and commercial sources with intelligence 
collection and data analytic capabilities based 
on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learn-
ing. Breaches of U.S. commercial and govern-
ment organizations also provide adversaries with 
data and insights into their target audiences. 
America's competitors 
weaponize information 
to a ack the values and 
institutions that underpin 
free societies, while 
shielding themselves from 
outside information.
35
P I L L A R  I I I :  P R E S E R V E  P E A C E  T H R O U G H  S T R E N G T H
China, for example, combines data and the use of AI 
to rate the loyal  of its citizens to the state and uses 
these ratings to determine jobs and more. Jihadist 
terrorist groups continue to wage ideological infor-
mation campaigns to establish and legitimize their
narrative of hate, using sophisticated communica-
tions tools to a ract recruits and encourage a acks 
against Americans and our partners. 
Russia uses information operations as part of its 
offensive cyber efforts to influence public opin-
ion across the globe. Its inÔ¨Ç uence campaigns blend 
covert intelligence operations and false online per-
sonas with state-funded media, third-party inter-
mediaries, and paid social media users or ‚Äútrolls.‚Äù 
U.S. e orts to counter the exploitation of informa-
tion by rivals have been tepid and fragmented. U.S. 
e orts have lacked a sustained focus and have been 
hampered by the lack of properly trained profes-
sionals. The American private sector has a direct 
interest in supporting and amplifying voices 
that stand for tolerance, openness, and freedom.
Priori  Actions 
PRIORITIZE THE COMPETITION: We will improve 
our understanding of how adversaries gain infor-
mational and psychological advantages across
all policies. The United States must empower 
a true public diplomacy capability to compete 
e ectively in this arena. 
DRIVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS: We will craft
and direct coherent communications campaigns 
to advance American inÔ¨Ç uence and counter chal-
lenges from the ideological threats that ema-
nate from radical Islamist groups and competitor 
nations.  ese campaigns will adhere to American
values and expose adversary propaganda and
disinformation. 
ACTIVATE LOCAL NETWORKS: Local voices are most 
compelling and effective in ideological competi-
tions. We must amplify credible voices and part-
ner with them to advance alternatives to violent 
and hateful messages. Since media and Internet 
companies are the platforms through which mes-
sages are transported, the private sector should 
lend its creativity and resources to promot-
ing the values that inspire and grow a commu-
nity of civilized groups and individuals.
SHARE RESPONSIBILITY: The United States will
urge states where radicalism thrives to take 
greater responsibility for countering violent 
messaging and promoting tolerant and pluralis-
tic worldviews. 
U P G R A D E ,  TA I L O R ,  A N D  I N N OVAT E :  We will 
reexamine legacy delivery platforms for com-
municating U.S. messages overseas. We must 
consider more cost-effective and efficient ways 
to deliver and evaluate content consistent with 
U.S. national security interests.

ur America First foreign policy cel-
ebrates America‚Äôs influence in the 
world as a positive force that can help 
set the conditions for peace and prosperity and
for developing successful societies. 
 ere is no arc of history that ensures that America‚Äôs
free political and economic system will automati-
cally prevail. Success or failure depends upon our 
actions. This Administration has the confidence 
to compete to protect our values and interests and 
the fundamental principles that underpin them. 
During the Cold War, a totalitarian threat from 
the Soviet Union motivated the free world to cre-
ate coalitions in defense of liberty. Today‚Äôs chal-
lenges to free societies are just as serious, but 
more diverse. State and non-state actors proj-
ect influence and advance their objectives by 
exploiting information, democratic media free-
doms, and international institutions. Repressive 
leaders often collaborate to subvert free societies 
and corrupt multilateral organizations. 
Around the world, nations and individuals admire 
what America stands for. We treat people equally 
and value and uphold the rule of law. We have 
a democratic system that allows the best ideas 
to flourish. We know how to grow economies so 
that individuals can achieve prosperity. These 
qualities have made America the richest coun-
try on earth‚Äîrich in culture, talent, opportuni-
ties, and material wealth. 
 e United States o ers partnership to those who 
share our aspirations for freedom and prosperity. 
We lead by example. ‚ÄúThe world has its eye upon 
America," Alexander Hamilton once observed. ‚Äú e 
noble struggle we have made in the cause of liber , 
has occasioned a kind of revolution in human sen-
timent. The influence of our example has pene-
trated the gloomy regions of despotism.‚Äù 
We are not going to impose our values on oth-
ers. Our alliances, partnerships, and coalitions 
are built on free will and shared interests. When 
the United States partners with other states, we 
develop policies that enable us to achieve our
goals while our partners achieve theirs. 
Allies and partners are a great strength of the 
United States. They add directly to U.S. politi-
cal, economic, military, intelligence, and other 
capabilities. Together, the United States and our 
allies and partners represent well over half of 
the global GDP. None of our adversaries have 
comparable coalitions. 
We encourage those who want to join our com-
munity of like-minded democratic states and 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
38
improve the condition of their peoples. By mod-
ernizing U.S. instruments of diplomacy and devel-
opment, we will catalyze conditions to help them 
achieve that goal.  ese aspiring partners include 
states that are fragile, recovering from conflict, 
and seeking a path forward to 
sustainable security and eco-
nomic growth. Stable, prosper-
ous, and friendly states enhance 
American security and boost 
U.S. economic opportunities.
We will continue to cham-
pion American values and 
offer encouragement to those 
struggling for human dig-
nity in their societies. There 
can be no moral equivalency 
between nations that uphold the 
rule of law, empower women, 
and respect individual rights 
and those that brutalize and suppress their peo-
ple. Through our words and deeds, America 
demonstrates a positive alternative to political 
and religious despotism.
Encourage Aspiring Partners
Some of the greatest triumphs of American state-
craft resulted from helping fragile and develop-
ing countries become successful societies. These
successes, in turn, created profitable markets for 
American businesses, allies to help achieve favor-
able regional balances of power, and coalition part-
ners to share burdens and address a varie  of prob-
lems around the world. Over time, the United States 
has helped create a network of states that advance 
our common interests and values.
 is historical record is unprecedented and excep-
tional. American support to aspiring partners
enabled the recovery of the countries of Western 
Europe under the Marshall Plan, as well as the 
ongoing integration of Central and Eastern Europe 
into Western institutions after the Cold War.
In Asia, the United States worked with South Korea 
and Japan, countries ravaged by war, to help them 
become successful democracies and among the
most prosperous economies 
in the world. 
These achievements were prod-
ucts of patient partnerships 
with those who aspired to build 
prosperous societies and join 
the community of democratic 
states. They resulted in mutu-
ally beneficial relationships in 
which the United States helped 
states mobilize their own
resources to achieve transitions 
to growth and stabili . Working 
with these countries made the
United States wealthier and 
more competitive. This progress illustrates how 
e ective foreign assistance programs should reach 
their natural endpoint. 
Today, the United States must compete for positive 
relationships around the world. China and Russia 
target their investments in the developing world to 
expand inÔ¨Ç uence and gain competitive advantages 
against the United States. China is investing bil-
lions of dollars in infrastructure across the globe. 
Russia, too, projects its influence economically,
through the control of key energy and other infra-
structure throughout parts of Europe and Central 
Asia.  e United States provides an alternative to 
state-directed investments, which often leave devel-
oping countries worse off. The United States pur-
sues economic ties not only for market access but 
also to create enduring relationships to advance 
common political and security interests. 
The United States will promote a development 
model that partners with countries that want prog-
ress, consistent with their culture, based on free 
market principles, fair and reciprocal trade, private 
 ere is no arc of history 
that ensures that America‚Äôs 
free political and economic 
system will automatically

depends upon our actions.

sector activity, and rule of law. The United States 
will shift away from a reliance on assistance based 
on grants to approaches that a ract private capital 
and catalyze private sector activi . We will empha-
size reforms that unlock the economic potential of 
citizens, such as the promotion of formal proper  
rights, entrepreneurial reforms, and infrastruc-
ture improvements‚Äîprojects that help people earn 
their livelihood and have the added beneÔ¨Å t of help-
ing U.S. businesses. By mobilizing both public and 
private resources, the United States can help maxi-
mize returns and outcomes and reduce the burden 
on U.S. Government resources. Unlike the state-di-
rected mercantilism of some competitors that 
can disadvantage recipient nations and promote 
dependency, the purpose of U.S. foreign assistance 
should be to end the need for it.  e United States 
seeks strong partners, not weak ones.
U.S. development assistance must support 
America‚Äôs national interests. We will prioritize col-
laboration with aspiring partners that are aligned 
with U.S. interests. We will focus on development 
investments where we can have the most impact‚Äî
where local reformers are committed to tackling 
their economic and political challenges.
Within this framework, the United States will 
also assist fragile states to prevent threats to the 
U.S. homeland. Transnational threat organiza-
tions, such as jihadist terrorists and organized 
crime, often operate freely from fragile states 
and undermine sovereign governments. Failing 
states can destabilize entire regions.
Across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, states are 
eager for investments and financing to develop 
their infrastructure and propel growth. The 
United States and its partners have opportuni-
ties to work with countries to help them real-
ize their potential as prosperous and sovereign 
states that are accountable to their people. Such 
states can become trading partners that buy more 
American-made goods and create more predict-
able business environments that beneÔ¨Å t American 
companies. American-led investments represent 
the most sustainable and responsible approach 
to development and offer a stark contrast to
the corrupt, opaque, exploitive, and low-qual-
ity deals offered by authoritarian states.
Priori  Actions: 
Developing Countries
MOB ILIZE R E SOU RCE S: The United States will 
modernize its development finance tools so that 
U.S. companies have incentives to capitalize on 
opportunities in developing countries. With 
these changes, the United States will not be left 
behind as other states use investment and proj-
ect finance to extend their influence. In addi-
tion, the U.S. Government must not be an obsta-
cle to U.S. companies that want to conduct 
business in the developing world. 
CAPITALIZE ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES: We will incor-
porate innovative technologies in our diplo-
matic and development programs. For exam-
ple, digital technologies enable millions to access 
financial services through their cell phones and 
can connect farmers to markets. Such technol-
ogies can reduce corruption, increase trans-
parency, and help ensure that money reaches 
its intended destination. 
INCENTIVIZE REFORMS: The United States will use
diplomacy and assistance to encourage states to 
make choices that improve governance, rule of 
law, and sustainable development. We already 
do this through the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation, which selects countries that are 
committed to reform and then monitors and 
evaluates their projects.
Priori  Actions: Fragile States
COMMIT SELECTIVELY: We will give priority to 
strengthening states where state weaknesses or
failure would magnify threats to the American 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
40
homeland. For instance, engagement in 
Afghanistan seeks to prevent the reemergence of 
terrorist safe havens. 
WORK WITH REFORMERS: Political problems are at 
the root of most state fragility. The United States 
will prioritize programs that empower reform-
minded governments, people, and civil socie . As
the United States designs its efforts, inputs from
local actors improve the likelihood of enduring 
solutions, reduce costs, and increase accountabil-
ity to the American taxpayer. 
SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS: The United States must 
use its diplomatic, economic, and military tools 
simultaneously when assisting aspiring part-
ners. We will place a priority on economic 
support that achieves local and macroeconomic
stability, helps build capable security forces, and
strengthens the rule of law. 
Achieve Be er Outcomes 
in Multilateral Forums
The United States must lead and engage in the 
multinational arrangements that shape many
of the rules that affect U.S. interests and values. 
A competition for influence exists in these insti-
tutions. As we participate in them, we must pro-
tect American sovereign  and advance American 
interests and values.
A range of international institutions establishes 
the rules for how states, businesses, and individ-
uals interact with each other, across land and sea, 
the Arctic, outer space, and the digital realm. It is 
vital to U.S. prosperi  and securi  that these insti-
tutions uphold the rules that help keep these com-
mon domains open and free. Free access to the seas 
remains a central principle of national security 
and economic prosperity, and exploration of sea
and space provides opportunities for commercial 
gain and scientiÔ¨Å c breakthroughs.  e Ô¨Ç ow of data 
and an open, interoperable Internet are insepara-
ble from the success of the U.S. economy. 
Authoritarian actors have long recognized the
power of multilateral bodies and have used them 
to advance their interests and limit the freedom 
of their own citizens. If the United States cedes 
leadership of these bodies to adversaries, oppor-
tunities to shape developments that are posi-
tive for the United States will be lost. All institu-
tions are not equal, however. The United States 
will prioritize its efforts in those organizations 
that serve American interests, to ensure that
they are strengthened and supportive of the 
United States, our allies, and our partners. Where 
existing institutions and rules need moderniz-
ing, the United States will lead to update them. 
At the same time, it should be clear that the United 
States will not cede sovereign  to those that claim
authority over American citizens and are in con-
flict with our constitutional framework. 
Priori  Actions 
EXERCISE LEADERSHIP IN POLITICAL AND SECURITY
BODIES:  e United States will strive for outcomes 
in political and security forums that are consis-
tent with U.S. interests and values‚Äîvalues which 
are shared by our allies and partners. The United 
Nations can help contribute to solving many of 
the complex problems in the world, but it must be 
reformed and recommit to its founding princi-
ples. We will require accountability and empha-
size shared responsibility among members. If the 
United States is asked to provide a disproportion-
ate level of support for an institution, we will expect 
a commensurate degree of influence over the 
direction and efforts of that institution.
SHAPE AND REFORM INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND 
TRADE INSTITUTIONS:  e United States will continue 
to play a leading role in institutions such as the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, 
and World Trade Organization (WTO), but will 
41
P I L L A R  I V :  A D V A N C E  A M E R I C A N  I N F L U E N C E
improve their performance through reforms.  ese 
reforms include encouraging multilateral devel-
opment banks to invest in high-quali  infrastruc-
ture projects that promote economic growth. We 
will press to make the WTO a more e ective forum 
to adjudicate unfair trade practices. 
E N S U R E  C O M M O N  D O M A I N S 
REMAIN FREE:  e United States 
will provide leadership and 
technology to shape and gov-
ern common domains‚Äîspace,
cyberspace, air, and mari-
time‚Äîwithin the framework of
international law. The United 
States supports the peace-
ful resolution of disputes 
under international law but 
will use all of its instruments 
of power to defend U.S. inter-
ests and to ensure common 
domains remain free. 
P R O T E C T  A  F R E E  A N D  O P E N 
INTERNET: The United States
will advocate for open, interoperable commu-
nications, with minimal barriers to the global 
exchange of information and services.  e United 
States will promote the free flow of data and pro-
tect its interests through active engagement in key 
organizations, such as the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the 
Internet Governance Forum (IGF), the UN, and the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Champion American Values
The extraordinary trajectory of the United States 
from a group of colonies to a thriving, industrial-
ized, sovereign republic‚Äîthe world's lone super-
power‚Äîis a testimony to the strength of the idea 
on which our Nation is founded, namely that 
each of our citizens is born free and equal under 
the law. America‚Äôs core principles, enshrined in 
the Declaration of Independence, are secured by 
the Bill of Rights, which proclaims our respect 
for fundamental individual liberties beginning 
with the freedoms of religion, speech, the press, 
and assembly. Liberty, free enterprise, equal 
justice under the law, and the dignity of every 
human life are central to who 
we are as a people.
 ese principles form the foun-
dation of our most endur-
ing alliances, and the United 
States will continue to cham-
pion them. Governments that 
respect the rights of their cit-
izens remain the best vehi-
cle for prosperity, human hap-
piness, and peace. In contrast, 
governments that routinely 
abuse the rights of their citi-
zens do not play constructive 
roles in the world. For example, 
governments that fail to treat 
women equally do not allow 
their societies to reach their potential.
No nation can unilaterally alleviate all human 
suffering, but just because we cannot help every-
one does not mean that we should stop trying 
to help anyone. For much of the world, America‚Äôs 
liberties are inspirational, and the United States 
will always stand with those who seek free-
dom. We will remain a beacon of liberty and 
opportunity around the world. 
The United States also remains committed to 
supporting and advancing religious freedom‚Äî
America‚Äôs first freedom. Our Founders under-
stood religious freedom not as the state‚Äôs creation, 
but as the gift of God to every person and a funda-
mental right for our flourishing society. 
And it is part of our culture, as well as in America‚Äôs 
interest, to help those in need and those trying to 
For much of the world,

build a be er future for their families. We aid oth-
ers judiciously, aligning our means to our objec-
tives, but with a firm belief that we can improve 
the lives of others while establishing conditions 
for a more secure and prosperous world. 
Priori  Actions 
SUPPORT THE DIGNITY OF INDIVIDUALS: We support, 
with our words and actions, those who live under 
oppressive regimes and who seek freedom, indi-
vidual dignity, and the rule of law. We are under 
no obligation to offer the benefits of our free and
prosperous communi  to repressive regimes and 
human rights abusers. We may use diplomacy, 
sanctions, and other tools to isolate states and lead-
ers who threaten our interests and whose actions 
run contrary to our values. We will not remain 
silent in the face of evil. We will hold perpetra-
tors of genocide and mass atrocities accountable.
DEFEAT TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS: 
There can be no greater action to advance the
rights of individuals than to defeat jihadist terror-
ists and other groups that foment hatred and use 
violence to advance their supremacist Islamist ide-
ologies. We will continue to join with other states to 
defeat this scourge of all civilized peoples.
E MPOWE R WOME N AND YOUTH : Societies that 
empower women to participate fully in civic and 
economic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful. We will support efforts to advance wom-
en‚Äôs equality, protect the rights of women and 
girls, and promote women and youth empower-
ment programs. 
PROTEC T R E LIG IO US FR E E DOM AN D R E LIG IO US 
MINORITIES: We will advocate on behalf of religious 
freedom and threatened minorities. Religious 
minorities continue to be victims of violence. We 
will place a priority on protecting these groups 
and will continue working with regional partners 
to protect minority communities from attacks 
and to preserve their cultural heritage. 
REDUCE HUMAN SUFFERING:  e United States will
continue to lead the world in humanitarian assis-
tance. Even as we expect others to share respon-
sibility, the United States will continue to cata-
lyze international responses to man-made and 
natural disasters and provide our expertise and 
capabilities to those in need. We will support
food security and health programs that save lives 
and address the root cause of hunger and dis-
ease. We will support displaced people close to 
their homes to help meet their needs until they 
can safely and voluntarily return home.

The United States must tailor our approaches to different regions of the 
world to protect U.S. national interests. We require integrated regional strat-
egies that appreciate the nature and magnitude of threats, the intensi  of 
competitions, and the promise of available opportunities, all in the context 
of local political, economic, social, and historical realities.
C
hanges in a regional balance of power can 
have global consequences and threaten 
U.S. interests. Markets, raw materi-
als, lines of communication, and human capital 
are located within, or move among, key regions 
of the world. China and Russia aspire to proj-
ect power worldwide, but they interact most with 
their neighbors. North Korea and Iran also pose 
the greatest menace to those closest to them. But, 
as destructive weapons proliferate and regions 
become more interconnected, threats become 
more difficult to contain. And regional balances 
that shift against the United States could combine 
to threaten our security. 
The United States must marshal the will and 
capabilities to compete and prevent unfavorable 
shifts in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle 
East. Sustaining favorable balances of power will 
require a strong commitment and close cooper-
ation with allies and partners because allies and 
partners magni  U.S. power and extend U.S. inÔ¨Ç u-
ence. They share our interests and responsibility 
for resisting authoritarian trends, contesting radi-
cal ideologies, and deterring aggression. 
In other regions of the world, instabili  and weak 
governance threaten U.S. interests. Some gov-
ernments are unable to maintain security and 
meet the basic needs of their people, making
their country and citizens vulnerable to preda-
tors. Terrorists and criminals thrive where gov-
ernments are weak, corruption is rampant, and 
faith in government institutions is low. Strategic 
competitors often exploit rather than discour-
age corruption and state weakness to extract
resources and exploit their populations. 
Regions afflicted by instability and weak govern-
ments also offer opportunities to improve secu-
ri , promote prosperi , and restore hope. Aspiring 
partner states across the developing world want 
to improve their societies, build transparent and 
e ective governments, confront non-state threats, 
and strengthen their sovereignty. Many recog-
nize the opportunities offered by market econo-
mies and political liberties and are eager for part-
nership with the United States and our allies.  e 
United States will encourage aspiring partners as
they undertake reforms and pursue their aspira-
tions. States that prosper and nations that tran-
sition from recipients of development assistance 
to trading partners offer economic opportunities 
for American businesses. And stability reduces 
threats that target Americans at home.
Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c 
A geopolitical competition between free and 
repressive visions of world order is taking place in 
the Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c region.  e region, which stretches 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
46
from the west coast of India to the western shores 
of the United States, represents the most populous 
and economically dynamic part of the world. The 
U.S. interest in a free and open Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c extends 
back to the earliest days of our republic. 
Although the United States seeks to continue to 
cooperate with China, China 
is using economic induce-
ments and penalties, influ-
ence operations, and implied 
military threats to persuade 
other states to heed its political 
and security agenda. China‚Äôs 
infrastructure investments 
and trade strategies reinforce 
its geopolitical aspirations. 
Its efforts to build and mili-
tarize outposts in the South 
China Sea endanger the free 
Ô¨Ç ow of trade, threaten the sov-
ereignty of other nations, and
undermine regional stabil-
ity. China has mounted a rapid military modern-
ization campaign designed to limit U.S. access to 
the region and provide China a freer hand there. 
China presents its ambitions as mutually ben-
eficial, but Chinese dominance risks diminish-
ing the sovereignty of many states in the Indo-
Pacific. States throughout the region are calling 
for sustained U.S. leadership in a collective 
response that upholds a regional order respect-
ful of sovereignty and independence. 
In Northeast Asia, the North Korean regime is 
rapidly accelerating its cyber, nuclear, and bal-
listic missile programs. North Korea‚Äôs pur-
suit of these weapons poses a global threat that 
requires a global response. Continued provo-
cations by North Korea will prompt neighbor-
ing countries and the United States to further 
strengthen security bonds and take additional 
measures to protect themselves. And a nucle-
ar-armed North Korea could lead to the prolif-
eration of the world‚Äôs most destructive weapons
across the Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c region and beyond.
U.S. allies are critical to responding to mutual 
threats, such as North Korea, and preserving our 
mutual interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Our 
alliance and friendship with South Korea, forged 
by the trials of history, is stron-
ger than ever. We welcome
and support the strong lead-
ership role of our critical ally, 
Japan. Australia has fought 
alongside us in every signif-
icant conf lict since World 
War I, and continues to rein-
force economic and security 
arrangements that support our 
shared interests and safeguard 
democratic values across 
the region. New Zealand is 
a key U.S. partner contrib-
uting to peace and security 
across the region. We welcome 
India‚Äôs emergence as a leading global power and 
stronger strategic and defense partner. We will 
seek to increase quadrilateral cooperation with 
Japan, Australia, and India. 
In Southeast Asia, the Philippines and Thailand 
remain important allies and markets for 
Americans. Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Singapore are growing security and economic 
partners of the United States. The Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-PaciÔ¨Å c 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) remain centerpieces 
of the Indo-PaciÔ¨Å c‚Äôs regional architecture and plat-
forms for promoting an order based on freedom.

partners that share respect for sovereign , fair and 
reciprocal trade, and the rule of law. We will rein-
force our commitment to freedom of the seas and 
the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime 
disputes in accordance with international law. 
We will work with allies and partners to achieve 
complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclear-
ization on the Korean Peninsula and preserve
the non-proliferation regime in Northeast Asia. 
ECONOMIC: The United States will encourage
regional cooperation to maintain free and open
seaways, transparent infrastructure financing 
practices, unimpeded commerce, and the peace-
ful resolution of disputes. We will pursue bilateral 
trade agreements on a fair and reciprocal basis. We 
will seek equal and reliable access for American 
exports. We will work with partners to build a net-
work of states dedicated to free markets and pro-
tected from forces that would subvert their sover-
eign . We will strengthen cooperation with allies 
on high-quality infrastructure. Working with 
Australia and New Zealand, we will shore up frag-
ile partner states in the Pacific Islands region to 
reduce their vulnerability to economic fluctu-
ations and natural disasters. 
MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will maintain a forward 
military presence capable of deterring and, if nec-
essary, defeating any adversary. We will strengthen 
our long-standing military relationships and 
encourage the development of a strong defense net-
work with our allies and partners. For example, 
we will cooperate on missile defense with Japan 
and South Korea to move toward an area defense 
capabili . We remain ready to respond with over-
whelming force to North Korean aggression and 
will improve options to compel denuclearization 
of the peninsula. We will improve law enforce-
ment, defense, and intelligence cooperation with 
Southeast Asian partners to address the growing 
terrorist threat. We will maintain our strong ties
with Taiwan in accordance with our ‚ÄúOne China‚Äù
policy, including our commitments under the
Taiwan Relations Act to provide for Taiwan‚Äôs legit-
imate defense needs and deter coercion. We will 
expand our defense and securi  cooperation with 
India, a Major Defense Partner of the United States, 
and support India‚Äôs growing relationships through-
out the region. We will re-energize our alliances
with the Philippines and  ailand and strengthen 
our partnerships with Singapore, Vietnam, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, and others to help them 
become cooperative maritime partners. 
Europe 
A strong and free Europe is of vital importance to 
the United States. We are bound together by our 
shared commitment to the principles of democracy, 
individual liber , and the rule of law. Together, we 
rebuilt Western Europe after World War II and cre-
ated institutions that produced stabili  and wealth 
on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, Europe is one
of the most prosperous regions in the world and 
our most signiÔ¨Å cant trading partner. 
Although the menace of Soviet communism is
gone, new threats test our will. Russia is using 
subversive measures to weaken the credibil-
ity of America‚Äôs commitment to Europe, under-
mine transatlantic unity, and weaken European 
institutions and governments. With its inva-
sions of Georgia and Ukraine, Russia demon-
strated its willingness to violate the sovereignty 
of states in the region. Russia continues to intim-
idate its neighbors with threatening behavior, 
such as nuclear posturing and the forward deploy-
ment of offensive capabilities. 
China is gaining a strategic foothold in Europe by 
expanding its unfair trade practices and invest-
ing in key industries, sensitive technologies, and 
infrastructure. Europe also faces immediate 
threats from violent Islamist extremists. Attacks 
by ISIS and other jihadist groups in Spain, France, 
Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and 
N A T I O N A L  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y
48
other countries show that our European partners 
continue to face serious threats. Instability in the 
Middle East and Africa has triggered the movement
of millions of migrants and refugees into Europe,
exacerbating instabili  and tensions in the region. 
 e United States is safer when Europe is prosper-
ous and stable, and can help defend our shared 
interests and ideals. The United States remains 
Ô¨Å rmly commi ed to our European allies and part-
ners. The NATO alliance of free and sovereign 
states is one of our great advantages over our com-
petitors, and the United States remains commit-
ted to Article V of the Washington Trea .
European allies and partners increase our strate-
gic reach and provide access to forward basing and 
overflight rights for global operations. Together 
we confront shared threats. European nations 
are contributing thousands of troops to help Ô¨Å ght 
jihadist terrorists in Afghanistan, stabilize Iraq,
and fight terrorist organizations across Africa 
and the greater Middle East.
 e NATO alliance will become stronger when all 
members assume greater responsibility for and 
pay their fair share to protect our mutual interests, 
sovereignty, and values. 
Priori  Actions
POLITICAL:  e United States will deepen collabora-
tion with our European allies and partners to con-
front forces threatening to undermine our com-
mon values, securi  interests, and shared vision. 
The United States and Europe will work together 
to counter Russian subversion and aggression, 
and the threats posed by North Korea and Iran. 
We will continue to advance our shared princi-
ples and interests in international forums.
ECONOMIC: The United States will work with the 
European Union, and bilaterally with the United 
Kingdom and other states, to ensure fair and recip-
rocal trade practices and eliminate barriers to 
growth. We will encourage European foreign direct 
investment in the United States to create jobs. We
will work with our allies and partners to diver-
si  European energy sources to ensure the energy 
security of European countries. We will work 
with our partners to contest China‚Äôs unfair trade 
and economic practices and restrict its acquisi-
tion of sensitive technologies.
MILITARY AND SECURITY: The United States ful-
fills our defense responsibilities and expects oth-
ers to do the same. We expect our European allies 
to increase defense spending to 2 percent of gross 
domestic product by 2024, with 20 percent of this 
spending devoted to increasing military capa-
bilities. On NATO‚Äôs eastern flank we will con-
tinue to strengthen deterrence and defense, and 
catalyze frontline allies and partners‚Äô efforts 
to better defend themselves. We will work with 
NATO to improve its integrated air and mis-
sile defense capabilities to counter existing and 
projected ballistic and cruise missile threats, 
particularly from Iran. We will increase counter-
terrorism and cybersecuri  cooperation.
Middle East
The United States seeks a Middle East that is 
not a safe haven or breeding ground for jihadist 
terrorists, not dominated by any power hostile to 
the United States, and that contributes to a stable
global energy market. 
For years, the interconnected problems of Iranian 
expansion, state collapse, jihadist ideology,
socio-economic stagnation, and regional rival-
ries have convulsed the Middle East. The United 
States has learned that neither aspirations for dem-
ocratic transformation nor disengagement can 
insulate us from the region‚Äôs problems. We must 
be realistic about our expectations for the region 
without allowing pessimism to obscure our inter-
ests or vision for a modern Middle East. 
49
T H E  S T R A T E G Y  I N  A  R E G I O N A L  C O N T E X T
 e region remains home to the world‚Äôs most dan-
gerous terrorist organizations. ISIS and al-Qa‚Äôida
thrive on instabili  and export violent jihad. Iran, 
the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism, has 
taken advantage of instability to expand its influ-
ence through partners and proxies, weapon prolif-
eration, and funding. It continues to develop more 
capable ballistic missiles and intelligence capa-
bilities, and it undertakes malicious cyber activ-
ities. These activities have continued unabated 
since the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran continues to per-
petuate the cycle of violence in the region, caus-
ing grievous harm to civilian populations. Rival 
states are filling vacuums created by state col-
lapse and prolonged regional conflict. 
Despite these challenges, there are emerging 
opportunities to advance American interests in 
the Middle East. Some of our partners are working
together to reject radical ideologies, and key lead-
ers are calling for a rejection of Islamist extrem-
ism and violence. Encouraging
political stability and sustain-
able prosperity would contrib-
ute to dampening the conditions 
that fuel sectarian grievances. 
For  g e n e r a t ion s  t h e  c on-
f lict between Israel and the 
Palestinians has been under-
stood as the prime irritant
preventing peace and pros-
perity in the region. Today, 
the threats from jihadist ter-
rorist organizations and the 
threat from Iran are creating the realization that 
Israel is not the cause of the region‚Äôs problems. 
States have increasingly found common inter-
ests with Israel in confronting common threats. 
Today, the United States has the opportunity to 
catalyze greater economic and political cooper-
ation that will expand prosperity for those who 
want to partner with us. By revitalizing partner-
ships with reform-minded nations and encour-
aging cooperation among partners in the region, 
the United States can promote stability and a bal-
ance of power that favors U.S. interests.
Priori  Actions
POLITICAL: We will strengthen partnerships, and 
form new ones, to help advance security through 
stability. Whenever possible, we will encourage 
gradual reforms. We will support e orts to counter 
violent ideologies and increase respect for the dig-
ni  of individuals. We remain commi ed to help-
ing our partners achieve a stable and prosperous 
region, including through a strong and integrated 
Gulf Cooperation Council. We will strengthen our 
long-term strategic partnership with Iraq as an
independent state. We will seek a se lement to the 
Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for refu-
gees to return home and rebuild their lives in safe . 
We will work with partners to deny the Iranian 
regime all paths to a nuclear 
weapon and neutralize Iranian 
malign influence. We remain
committed to helping facilitate 
a comprehensive peace agree-
ment that is acceptable to both
Israelis and Palestinians.
ECONOMIC: The United States 
will support the reforms under-
way that begin to address core 
inequities that jihadist terror-
ists exploit. We will encourage 
states in the region, including 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to continue moderniz-
ing their economies. We will play a role in catalyz-
ing positive developments by engaging economi-
cally, supporting reformers, and championing the 
benefits of open markets and societies.

balance of power. We will assist regional part-
ners in strengthening their institutions and 
capabilities, including in law enforcement, to 
conduct counterterrorism and counterinsur-
gency efforts. We will help partners procure 
interoperable missile defense and other capa-
bilities to better defend against active missile 
threats. We will work with partners to neutral-
ize Iran‚Äôs malign activities in the region.
South and Central Asia 
With over a quarter of the world‚Äôs population, a 
Ô¨Å fth of all U.S.-designated terrorist groups, several 
fast-growing economies, and two nuclear-armed 
states, South and Central Asia present some of the 
most complicated national security challenges 
and opportunities. The region spans the terrorist 
threats emanating from the Middle East and the 
competition for power unfolding in Europe and 
the Indo-Pacific. The United States continues to 
face threats from transnational terrorists and mili-
tants operating from within Pakistan.  e prospect
for an Indo-Pakistani military conflict that could 
lead to a nuclear exchange remains a key concern
requiring consistent diplomatic a ention.
U.S. interests in the region include countering ter-
rorist threats that impact the security of the U.S. 
homeland and our allies, preventing cross-border 
terrorism that raises the prospect of military and 
nuclear tensions, and preventing nuclear weap-
ons, technology, and materials from falling into 
the hands of terrorists. We seek an American pres-
ence in the region proportionate to threats to the
homeland and our allies. We seek a Pakistan that is 
not engaged in destabilizing behavior and a stable 
and self-reliant Afghanistan. And we seek Central 
Asian states that are resilient against domination 
by rival powers, are resistant to becoming jihad-
ist safe havens, and prioritize reforms. 
Priori  Actions 
POLITICAL: We will deepen our strategic partner-
ship with India and support its leadership role 
in Indian Ocean security and throughout the 
broader region. We will press Pakistan to inten-
sify its counterterrorism efforts, since no part-
nership can survive a country‚Äôs support for mil-
itants and terrorists who target a partner‚Äôs own 
service members and officials. The United States 
will also encourage Pakistan to continue demon-
strating that it is a responsible steward of its 
nuclear assets. We will continue to partner with 
Afghanistan to promote peace and securi  in the 
region. We will continue to promote anti-corrup-
tion reform in Afghanistan to increase the legit-
imacy of its government and reduce the appeal of 
violent extremist organizations. We will help South 
Asian nations maintain their sovereign  as China 
increases its influence in the region. 
ECONOMIC: We will encourage the economic inte-
gration of Central and South Asia to promote 
prosperity and economic linkages that will bol-
ster connectivity and trade. And we will encour-
age India to increase its economic assistance 
in the region. In Pakistan, we will build trade 
and investment ties as security improves and as 
Pakistan demonstrates that it will assist the United
States in our counterterrorism goals.
MILITARY AND SECURIT Y: We are committed to 
supporting the Afghan government and security 
forces in their Ô¨Å ght against the Taliban, al-Qa‚Äôida,
ISIS, and other terrorists. We will bolster the 
fighting strength of the Afghan security forces 
to convince the Taliban that they cannot win on 
the battlefield and to set the conditions for diplo-
matic efforts to achieve enduring peace. We will 
insist that Pakistan take decisive action against 
militant and terrorist groups operating from its 
soil. We will work with the Central Asian states
to guarantee access to the region to support our 
counterterrorism efforts.

Western Hemisphere enhance our security and

that killed tens of thousands of people. Today, 
this region stands on the cusp of prosperity and 
peace, built upon democracy and the rule of law. 
U.S. trade in the region is thriving and market 
opportunities for American goods and services, 
energy and infrastructure projects, and foreign 
direct investment continue to expand. 
Challenges remain, however. Transnational crim-
inal organizations‚Äîincluding gangs and cartels‚Äî
perpetuate violence and corruption, and threaten 
the stability of Central American states includ-
ing Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In 
Venezuela and Cuba, governments cling to anach-
ronistic leftist authoritarian models that con-
tinue to fail their people. Competitors have found 
operating space in the hemisphere. 
China seeks to pull the region into its orbit through 
state-led investments and loans. Russia contin-
ues its failed politics of the Cold War by bolster-
ing its radical Cuban allies as Cuba continues to 
repress its citizens. Both China and Russia sup-
port the dictatorship in Venezuela and are seek-
ing to expand military linkages and arms sales 
across the region. The hemisphere‚Äôs democratic 
states have a shared interest in confronting threats 
to their sovereignty.
Canada and the United States share a unique 
strategic and defense partnership. The United 
States also has important and deepening rela-
tions with key countries in the region. Together, 
we will build a stable and peaceful hemisphere 
that increases economic opportunities for all, 
improves governance, reduces the power of crim-
inal organizations, and limits the malign influ-
ence of non-hemispheric forces. 
Priori  Actions
POLITICAL: We will catalyze regional e orts to build 
securi  and prosperi  through strong diplomatic 
engagement. We will isolate governments that
refuse to act as responsible partners in advancing 
hemispheric peace and prosperi . We look forward 
to the day when the people of Cuba and Venezuela 
can enjoy freedom and the beneÔ¨Å ts of shared pros-
perity, and we encourage other free states in the
hemisphere to support this shared endeavor.
ECONOMIC: We will modernize our trade agree-
ments and deepen our economic ties with the
region and ensure that trade is fair and reciprocal. 
We will encourage further market-based economic
reforms and encourage transparency to create con-
ditions for sustained prosperity. We will ensure 
the U.S. Ô¨Å nancial system does not serve as a haven 
or transit point for criminal proceeds.
MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will build upon local
efforts and encourage cultures of lawfulness to 
reduce crime and corruption, including by sup-
porting local efforts to professionalize police and 
other security forces; strengthen the rule of law 
and undertake judicial reform; and improve infor-
mation sharing to target criminals and corrupt 
leaders and disrupt illicit trafficking.

Africa
Africa remains a continent of promise and endur-
ing challenges. Africa contains many of the world‚Äôs 
fastest growing economies, which represent poten-
tial new markets for U.S. goods and services. 
Aspiring partners across the continent are eager
to build market-based economies and enhance sta-
bili .  e demand for quali  American exports is 
high and will likely grow as Africa‚Äôs population and 
prosperi  increase. People across the continent are 
demanding government accountability and less 
corruption, and are opposing autocratic trends.  e 
number of stable African nations has grown since
the independence era as numerous countries have 
emerged from devastating conÔ¨Ç icts and undergone 
democratic transitions.
Despite this progress, many states face political 
turbulence and instability that spills into other 
regions. Corruption and weak governance threaten 
to undermine the political 
benefits that should emerge
from new economic opportu-
nities. Many African states 
are battlegrounds for vio-
lent extremism and jihad-
ist terrorists. ISIS, al-Qa‚Äôida, 
and their affiliates oper-
ate on the continent and 
have increased the lethal-
ity of their attacks, expanded 
into new areas, and targeted 
U.S. citizens and interests. 
African nations and regional 
organizations have demon-
strated a commitment to confront the threat 
from jihadist terrorist organizations, but their 
security capabilities remain weak.
China is expanding its economic and military 
presence in Africa, growing from a small inves-
tor in the continent two decades ago into Africa‚Äôs 
largest trading partner today. Some Chinese prac-
tices undermine Africa‚Äôs long-term development 
by corrupting elites, dominating extractive indus-
tries, and locking countries into unsustainable 
and opaque debts and commitments. 
The United States seeks sovereign African states 
that are integrated into the world economy, able 
to provide for their citizens‚Äô needs, and capable of
managing threats to peace and securi . Improved 
governance in these states supports economic 
development and opportunities, diminishes the 
a raction of illegal migration, and reduces vulner-
abili  to extremists, thereby reducing instabili . 
Priori  Actions
POLITICAL: The United States will partner with
governments, civil society, and regional organi-
zations to end long-running, violent conflicts. 
We will encourage reform, working with prom-
ising nations to promote effective governance, 
improve the rule of law, and 
develop institutions account-
able and responsive to cit-
izens. We will continue to 
respond to humanitarian 
needs while also working
with commi ed governments
and regional organizations 
to address the root causes of 
human suffering. If neces-
sary, we are prepared to sanc-
tion government officials
and institutions that prey 
on their citizens and com-
mit atrocities. When there is 
no alternative, we will suspend aid rather than 
see it exploited by corrupt elites. 
ECONOMIC: We will expand trade and commercial 
ties to create jobs and build wealth for Americans 
and Africans. We will work with reform-oriented 
governments to help establish conditions that can 
transform them into trading partners and improve 
We will encourage reform, 
working with promising nations 
to promote e ective governance, 
improve the rule of law, and 
develop institutions accountable 
and responsive to citizens.

their business environment. We will support eco-
nomic integration among African states. We will 
work with nations that seek to move beyond assis-
tance to partnerships that promote prosperity. 
We will offer American goods and services, both 
because it is proÔ¨Å table for us and because it serves 
as an alternative to China‚Äôs often extractive eco-
nomic footprint on the continent. 
MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will continue to work 
with partners to improve the ability of their secu-
rity services to counter terrorism, human traf-
ficking, and the illegal trade in arms and natural 
resources. We will work with partners to defeat 
terrorist organizations and others who threaten 
U.S. citizens and the homeland.

 is National Securi  Strategy sets a positive strategic direction for the United 
States that is meant to reassert America‚Äôs advantages on the world stage and to 
build upon our country‚Äôs great strengths. During the Trump Administration, 
the American people can be conÔ¨Å dent that their securi  and prosperi  will 
always come Ô¨Å rst. A secure, prosperous, and free America will be strong and 
ready to lead abroad to protect our interests and our way of life. 
A
merica‚Äôs renewed strategic confidence
is anchored in our recommitment to 
the principles inscribed in our found-
ing documents. The National Security Strategy
celebrates and protects what we hold dear‚Äî
individual liberty, the rule of law, a democratic 
system of government, tolerance, and opportuni  
for all. By knowing ourselves and what we stand 
for, we clari  what we must defend and we estab-

ism. It is realist because it acknowledges the 
central role of power in international poli-
tics, affirms that sovereign states are the best 
hope for a peaceful world, and clearly defines
