(a)(i) See MP5301.601(a)(i) for the DAF Approval Authority Matrix.
5301.601-91 Department of the Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Program
(a) The DAF Self-Inspection program assesses compliance with federal laws, regulatory policies, DoD and DAF
directives, and instructions across the enterprise. It is also used to verify adequacy of contract preparation.
(b) SCOs will manage a self-inspection program, which includes both the assessment of individual contract files and
the assessment of contracting management programs contained in the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) Self-
Assessment Checklists (SACs) as required by DAFI 90-302, The Inspection System of the Department of the Air Force, and
the assessment of individual contract files. As a minimum, contracting offices must perform post-award self-inspections of
individual contract files on an annual basis. The results of the assessment of contracting management programs contained in
the SACs are reported in MICT by individual units. The results of self-inspection of individual contract files are not reported
in MICT.
(c) For self-inspection of individual FAR-based contract files reviewed after award, to include Special Access Programs
(SAP)/classified contract files, SCOs shall use the Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Checklist.For Contracting offices
listed in KT FileShare (KTFS), the self-inspections shall be performed utilizing the KTFS Inspection tool beginning no
later than 1 October 2024 in order to capture self-inspection results. For contracting offices not listed in KTFS, the self-
inspection summary data shall be submitted into the AFMC/PKQ Automated Self-Inspection Reporting Tool (ASIRT). For
SAP/classified contracts reviewed, releasable results shall be reported to SAF/AQCS via secure means for briefing to SAF/
AQC.
(d) SCOs will ensure corrective actions are implemented as a result of any self-inspection findings. Contracting offices
must have a documented program for self-inspection, to include a process for closing resolved findings in a timely manner,
ensuring an effective level of review necessary to close a finding, and integrating findings and resolutions into unit training.
(e) SCOs must review 8% (5% for FY24 only) of their contract actions each fiscal year.  Business/contract clearances
shall not be counted towards meeting the required 8% of contracting actions reviewed. Maintaining a robust self-inspection
program and sharing the data results will support a DAF-wide consolidated trend analysis report for the previous fiscal
year. All reviews in KTFS, summary reporting in ASIRT, and SAP/classified reporting for the previous fiscal year must be
completed by 15 February of each year.

(2) To facilitate planning for clearances that require HCA approval, SCOs must use the Peer Review and Clearance
Forecasting Tool to project upcoming HCA clearances. See DAFFARS 5301.170(a)(2).
(3) Only one clearance review may be performed prior to the contract action being presented to the CAA. The CR
is responsible for the clearance review. The CAA may select an alternate CR who meets the requirements identified in
DAFFARS 5301.9000. The CAA has the authority to waive the clearance review.
(4) The CAA must seek legal advice (see DAFFARS 5301.602-2(c)(i)) and ensure that counsel has coordinated on any
clearance briefings or presentations, and that counsel’s comments are included in the briefing or presentation.
(5) The Milestone Decision Authority, PEO, or lead program manager must coordinate and/or participate in business
clearance briefings.
(6) At the discretion of the CAA, contract clearance is not required when the negotiation team stays within the pre-set
negotiation range and the parameters approved at the business clearance.
(7) If the CAA has waived business or contract clearance, a clearance review is not required unless the CAA stipulates
otherwise. However, legal review is required, as applicable, in accordance with DAFFARS 5301.602-2(c)(i).
(8) If a CAA requires clearance for competitive order solicitations or orders when excluded in accordance with
DAFFARS 5301.9000(b)(6), the SCO must submit a written justification to cognizant HCA upon execution.

SUBPART 5301.91 - OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9103
Subpart 5301.91 - OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose
The purpose of the DAF ombudsman program is to foster communication between Government and industry. The primary
function of the ombudsman is to hear concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to
senior management personnel responsible for oversight and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. In accordance with
5301.9102(f) below, employees, managers and customers may use the DAF component ombudsman when seeking assistance
in resolving procurement integrity issues.
5301.9102 Policy
(a) MAJCOM/DRU/DAFRCO/ Commanders must appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the
contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their organization. For AFMC Centers, an ombudsman is
required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. Centers may also have an ombudsman at each Operating Location/
Geographically Separated Unit. At SSC, SpRCO, and SDA, the HCA is responsible for the ombudsman appointment.
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition
issues or concerns (e.g., administrative support, independent review teams).
(c) Contracting officers must identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft
and final RFP.
(d) The ombudsman must:
(1) Support acquisition personnel in the resolution of issues or concerns raised by interested parties;
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the interested party and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties;
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and
source selection authority);
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the Commander/Director, or PEO, as required, of issues raised and actions taken;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task order and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C.
3403(d)(1)(B) or 3405(f) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders and
delivery orders in excess of the micro-purchase threshold, consistent with the procedures in the contract;
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts
relevant to the resolution of issues raised by interested parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information.
Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes.
(f) The DAF ombudsman is the ADAS(C), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements,
and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU level, or for those having DAF wide
implications. The ADAS(C) is the DAF ombudsman for procurement integrity issues (see OUSD(AT&L)/DPC memo, 1 Oct
09).
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation Provision and Contract Clause
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at DAFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations
(including draft solicitations) and contracts.

(a) See MP5301.601(a)(i) when supplementing specific definitions to identify individuals who occupy positions specified
in FAR 3.104-3(d)(1)(ii), and any clauses required by 3.104.
(b)(6) Former federal employees have a continuing obligation to the Government not to disclose or misuse any other
information acquired as part of their official duties and which is not generally available to the public.
5303.104-3 Statutory and Related Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Requirements
(a) Similar to knowledge of classified information, employee protective obligations of Government acquisition
information extend beyond federal service. Failure to comply with protective obligations during and after federal service
would support potential determinations of personal and organizational conflicts of interest, as well as potential determinations
to eliminate contractors from competing on certain acquisitions due to conflicts of interest.
(c)(1)(ii) See MP5301.601(a)(i) for individuals authorized to approve resumption of participation in a procurement.
5303.104-4 Disclosure, Protection, and Marking of Contractor Bid or Proposal Information and Source Selection
Information
(a) When it comes to safeguarding public data, trust is paramount. Contract management security and data privacy
are critical. Contracting data produced or maintained by the Contracting workforce must also be handled in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations to safeguard this data. Any individuals requiring access to contract data as a result of
participating on a source selection or in the performance of their duties must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
i. Contracting Officers must ensure appropriate clauses and data protections are included in any contract, order
or agreement providing the assistance of support personnel. Since contract data may include sensitive or proprietary
information, it is important to protect restricted data sets from improper use. Contractors whose employees have been
determined to have a “Need to know” by the data requesting organization shall have Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs),
Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) mitigation plans, necessary information owner permissions and any applicable
contract clauses or articles prior to gaining access to any contracting system restricted data sets. Confirmation of these items
is the responsibility of the organizations requesting access to the data and organizations are required to provide the items
upon request.
ii. Before giving contractors access to contracting data, Contracting Officers shall ensure that the government team
has verified that safeguarding actions have been taken and processes have been put into place to protect the contracting data.
This verification shall be documented using the Compliance Certification Contracting Access and Security (CCCAS) Memo
template. Once completed, the CCCAS template shall be uploaded into the Contracting Modernization SharePoint Site to
establish an auditable record that due diligence has been taken to safeguard contracting data.
Note for DAFFARS 5303.104-4(a)(ii): Atch 4 of SAF/AQC memo 24-C-04 will be made into a DAFFARS template
and archived within the Air Force Contracting Central (AFCC) templates when the 2024 DAFAC is finalized – once
this action is complete, this note will be removed from the DAFFARS language
iii. A singular Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) for both DAFFARS 5303.104-4(a) and FAR clause 52.203-16
“PREVENTING PERSONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST” may be completed and remain on file by the requesting
government or contractor organization for the term of employment rather than accomplished annually, as long as both
provisions are referenced in the NDA.
5303.104-5 Disqualification
(a) Contracting officers should consider ways to engage potential offerors early and respond to industry queries, pursuant
to the contracting officer’s responsibilities under FAR 9.504, to determine whether former federal employees should be
excluded from proposal preparation. When Contracting officers become aware that a former federal employee is involved
in a contractor’s proposal preparation, the CO shall determine whether that employee should be excluded from the proposal
preparation effort. The CO shall document the supporting rationale within the determination as to whether the former federal
employee should be excluded from the proposal preparation efforts or not. In addition to the ethics advisory opinions under
FAR 3.104-6, should a former federal employee participate in preparing a competitive proposal on behalf of an employer
or client, and it relates to the prior employment as a federal employee, the individual should inform his/her employer/client
of this fact and have that entity communicate such facts to the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 3.104 and FAR
9.505. One of the guiding principles established by the decisions of the courts is the obligation of contracting agencies to
5303.1-1
Revised June 12, 2024
5303.104-7
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
avoid even the appearance of impropriety in government procurements. See FAR 3.101-1. In this regard, where a firm may
have gained an unfair competitive advantage through its hiring of a former government official, the contracting officer may
disqualify a firm from a competition based on the appearance of impropriety tied to an organizational conflict of interest
which is created by this situation, that is, even if no actual impropriety can be shown.
(b) In addition to the cognizant parties identified at FAR 3.104-5(b), if the source selection authority is the DAFRCO/
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/FOA/DRU/CC or CD, the disqualification notice must be coordinated through the DAFRCO/
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/FOA/DRU JA and the SCO. The notice must include the items at FAR 3.104-5(b) and the following:
(1) Name of requestor
(2) Current position/job title
(3) Projected retirement date
(4) Impact on program/unit mission if disqualification is granted
(5) Proposed replacement individual for official acquisition duties
(6) Commander/Director recommendation
(c) Resumption of participation in a procurement
The contracting officer, after consultation with the parties identified in paragraph (b), will notify the individual if he or she
is disqualified. The individual will remain disqualified unless resumption of participation in the procurement is granted in
accordance with this paragraph.
(2) See MP5301.601(a)(i). In cases where the SCO is the individual disqualified from participation in a procurement,
the cognizant HCA must authorize the individual to resume participation in the procurement. SAF/AQ and SAF/SQ and
their civilian or military deputies have the authority to permit the cognizant HCA to resume participation in a procurement
following contact with an offeror regarding non-Federal employment.
5303.104-7 Violations or possible violations
(a) When a potential Procurement Integrity Act (PIA) violation is alleged, the contracting officer must notify their
cognizant Clearance Approval Authority (CAA), legal counsel, cognizant HCA (as defined in DAFFARS 5302), and the
DAS(C) (SAF/AQC or, for classified programs, SAF/AQCS). This notification to all parties should identify the cognizant
CAA and shall be accomplished within 7 business days of initial discovery. The contracting officer will subsequently provide
a copy of the information and documentation generated under FAR 3.104-7 to those same stakeholders and to SAF/GCR.
(1) The contracting officer must forward the information and determination required by FAR 3.104-7(a)(1) to the
clearance approval authority ( DAFFARS 5301.9001(i) ) of the affected procurement for review.
(g) See MP5301.601(a)(i).
5303.104-9 Contract Clauses
(b) If information received under FAR 52.203-10, Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity, indicates that
a price or fee adjustment may be appropriate, the contracting officer must submit notification to the SCO, cognizant HCA and
to SAF/GCR.

Subpart 5304.4 - SAFEGUARDING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITHIN INDUSTRY
5304.402-90 General
(a) 32 CFR Part 117 and DAFMAN 16-1406V2, National Industrial Security Program: Industrial Security Procedures for
Government Activities, clarify contracting officer responsibilities and provides guidance for implementing the Department of
the Air Force’s National Industrial Security Program. 
(b)  DAFH 16-1406 , National Interest Determination Handbook. This instruction clarifies responsibilities and procedures
for processing National Interest Determinations (NID).
(c) Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 16-7 Special Access Programs establishes policies and responsibilities for the
management, administration, and oversight of Special Access Programs for which the Air Force has Cognizant Authority..
(d) DAFI 10-701 , Operations Security, establishes responsibilities for contracting officers when there are OPSEC
requirements on contract.
(e) In accordance with FAR part 4.4, DAF personnel will use the NISP Contract Classification System (NCCS) to process
DD Form 254s, provided that the data submitted is unclassified. For contracts where the content of the DD Form 254 contains
classified information and the classified information cannot be segregated into classified attachments or addendums, use of
NCCS is not required until such time that an automated solution is available on the appropriate classified information system.
NCCS is available electronically at https://www.dcsa.mil/is/nccs.
(f) Additional DD254 guidance:
(1) Solicitation/Award DD Form 254:
A solicitation DD Form 254 is required to be drafted, coordinated, and certified in block 17 IAW DoD and Air Force
industrial security policy requirements. The coordinated and certified DD Form 254 shall be attached to the solicitation that
is provided to the vendor(s). Distribution of the solicitation DD Form 254 per Air Force Industrial Security Policy is not
required unless the vendor requires access to classified information during the pre-award phase of the contract. Solicitation
means any request to submit offers or quotations to the Government. As such the solicitation stage includes but is not limited
to: Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ),
Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA), Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), Grants, Cooperative
Agreement, Other Transactions (OT) and other extraordinary actions. A new, original DD Form 254 is required to be drafted,
coordinated, certified, and distributed and shall be attached to the contract award.
(2) IDIQ:
Basic Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (IDV) and Indefinite Delivery Vehicle Quantity (IDIQ) contracts or agreements as
defined in FAR 4.601 in which there is no requirement for a breakdown by classification of the various elements of the
classified effort may utilize the same DD Form 254 for the entire IDV contract. In this case, a separate DD Form 254 will not
be required for delivery, task orders, or equivalent pending all the security requirements are identical for each order against
the IDV contract or agreement, at the discretion of the servicing Contracting Officer and will be documented in block 13.
If the security requirements for the task, delivery, or purchase order for a contract or agreement result in additional security
requirements from that of the basic DD Form 254, a revised basic DD Form 254 is required. The servicing Contracting
Officer will determine how to document use of the basic DD Form 254 on all delivery, purchase, or task orders for all prime
contracts or agreements, if applicable. If it is determined that a DD Form 254 at the IDV contract level will not cover varying
needs of the classified effort in each delivery order, then a separate DD Form 254 should still be done for each delivery/task
order as long as the separate DD Form 254 does not contain security requirements above that of the basic DD Form 254.
(3) Contract novation:
A new original DD Form 254 is required to be drafted, coordinated, certified, and distributed upon the finalization of a
contract novation. The new original DD Form 254 will identify the new vendor and prime contract number. If the new vendor
does not possess the requisite level of facility clearance, the vendor will be sponsored for a facility clearance IAW Air Force
industrial security policy requirements.
5304.403 Responsibilities of Contracting Officers
(a) In accordance with the FAR part 4.4, the contracting officer is responsible for reviewing all proposed solicitations
to determine whether access to classified information may be required by offerors or by a contractor during contract
performance.
(b) Contracting officers will require input and support from program managers, project managers, or other personnel
knowledgeable of the contract requirements to perform this responsibility.

(d) The tailorable Contract Type Determination and Findings template at 5316.103(d) may be used to document contract
type selections for acquisitions not requiring a written acquisition plan.
(e) Prepare written acquisition plans in accordance with FAR 7.103 and the dollar thresholds identified at DFARS
207.103(d)(i). Notwithstanding the requirements DFARS 207.103(e), acquisition plans may be written on a program basis
when the requiring activity chooses to write a single plan for all known program actions or on an individual contract basis
when there is only one contract, task or delivery order to be covered by the plan. An acquisition plan is not required for
individual orders when the contract-level acquisition plan adequately covers all anticipated orders and the order is issued
IAW the terms of the basic contract.
(h) Contracting officers shall maintain decision support information in the contract file for acquisitions that do not require
written acquisition plans as well as those that do. Where a written plan is not required, contract documentation such as
memoranda for record, market research reports (i.e., Streamlined Market Acquisition Approach Document (SMRAA)),
and Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS) may be used to record acquisition pre-award decisions and risk
assessment information. The acquisition team shall ensure consistency among requirements, acquisition planning, market
research, and solicitation documents and, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication of information between documents (e.g.,
by referencing content).
(i) Unless otherwise designated by the acquisition approving authority, the planner for acquisitions is the program
manager, or other official responsible for the program (i.e., requiring activity).
(j) The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) holds acquisition approving authority unless otherwise designated in DAFI
63-101/20-101 , Integrated Life Cycle Management and DAFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services. Unless otherwise prohibited
by regulation or policy, the acquisition approving authority may delegate acquisition plan approval to one level above the
contracting officer for other than firm-fixed-price contracts and the contracting officer for firm-fixed-price contracts.
(l) An Acquisition Plan template is available for preparing written acquisition plans.
(m) Only the acquisition approving authority may waive requirements of detail and formality.
5307.104 General Procedures
(a)(1) Where a written acquisition plan is required, an Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) shall be convened and chaired by
the acquisition approving authority. ASP shall consist of members responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition, such
as contracting, small business, fiscal, legal, and technical personnel. Unless waived by the acquisition approving authority, an
ASP briefing shall be prepared by the planner and presented to the acquisition plan approving authority to allow discussion
of the proposed strategy and promote an informed decision prior to approval of the plan. Written ASP briefing material
may serve as the written acquisition plan provided documents address the acquisition plan content requirements of FAR
7.105 and DFARS 207.105. Acquisition planning templates, including ASP briefing templates, can be found on https://
www.afacpo.com/apm/core-documents/templates/or by using the AF Acquisition Process Model tool.
(2) Regardless of dollar value, if a proposed change is for a new work outside the scope of the original acquisition plan,
a revised acquisition plan based on the value of the new work shall be prepared. Whenever significant changes occur, the
planner shall prepare a revised acquisition plan and a statement that summarizes the changes and obtain concurrence of the
ASP and approval from the acquisition approving authority.
(c) Before convening an ASP for DAF programs greater than $1B, the planner shall also coordinate with the DAF
Intellectual Property (IP) Cadre (SAF/AQCC) in acquisition planning. Planners may coordinate with DAF IP Cadre on
acquisition strategies of any dollar value where advice and assistance are needed to develop a robust IP strategy IAW
5307.105 Contents of Written Acquisition Plans(b)(14)(iii). Coordination requests should be sent to the DAF IP Cadre

5315.405 Price Negotiation
(d) In situations where a contractor inadequately supports the proposed price as fair and reasonable despite all attempts
by the contracting officer to secure adequate justification through negotiations, these situations should be elevated and
documented as described herein. When the contractor insists on a cost/price or demands a profit or fee that the contracting
officer considers unreasonable, the contracting officer shall notify the authority one level above the contracting officer and
using the instructions in the link immediately submit an  Egregious Pricing Incident Report  to  SAF/AQC Workflow , and
the  cognizant HCA Workflow  (if HCA is other than DAS(C) or ADAS(C)). The contracting officer shall also inform the
contractor that such action has been taken and continue to attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable cost/price.
(1) If the Egregious Pricing situation is not resolved through negotiations, the offeror is ineligible for award unless the
cognizant HCA determines, in writing, that it is in the best interest of the Government to make award to that offeror, based on
consideration of the following:
(i) The program or mission partner need for the item(s) or service(s) in terms of the specific mission contribution;
(ii) The challenges to reaching and efforts made to reach a fair and reasonable cost/price; and
(iii) Increased cost or harm to the Government if award is not made.
(2) The PEO or Wing Commander (or other corresponding authority) and SCO shall certify to the cognizant HCA that
the conditions listed in (d)(1) exist and award should be made. DAFFARS 5301.7 provides instructions for the submission of
the Determination and Findings (D&F).
(3) Contracting officers, with coordination from the cognizant SCO, must report price negotiation situations, where (d)
(1) applies, to the  SAF/AQC Workflow  and the  cognizant HCA Workflow  (if HCA is other than DAS(C) or ADAS(C))
no later than 30 days after negotiations have concluded. Update the  Egregious Pricing Incident Report  completed under
paragraph (d) with post-negotiation information and submit a copy of the final negotiation memorandum and D&F as
attachments.
(4) The procedures specified in (d)(1-3) above apply to situations where certified cost and pricing data are required
and to situations when certified cost and pricing data are not required. If used in situations where other than certified cost or
pricing data is required and FAR 15.403-3(a)(4) applies, contracting officers should also complete reporting requirements
required under DAFFARS 5315.403-3(a)(6)(ii) above.
5315.406-1 Prenegotiation Objectives
(b)(ii) Adjudication Procedures. The contracting officer must forward DCAA requests for Air Force management review
through their management chain and provide the SCO name and contact information to the cognizant DCAA representative.
If disagreements remain, the SCO must elevate the issue to the  cognizant HCA Workflow  to support any request from
DCAA for further elevation of the issue(s).
(b)(90) A Preliminary Price Negotiation Memorandum (PPNM) is required for all actions of $10M or more. The DAF
PPNM template may be tailored for use.
5315.406-2 Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data
To aid contractors in submitting properly executed Certificates of Current Cost or Pricing Data, contracting officers may
provide the fillable Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data template to use as a guide.
5315.406-3 Documenting the Negotiation
(a) See the Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) Checklist that may be used to ensure PNMs contain all required
information. For contract actions valued below the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data threshold, the DAF Streamlined PNM
Format for supplies or services is available for use. If the value of the contract action exceeds the Truthful Cost or Pricing
Data threshold and no exception to the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data threshold applies, pricing documentation is expected
to address the cost element composition of the proposed, objective, and negotiated positions at an appropriate level of
detail based on the value and complexity of the pricing action. The final PNM template and streamlined PNM templates for
supplies or services may be tailored for use.

Cost Agreement). As a condition precedent to the use of a pre-contract cost agreement, the correct type of funds should be
available upon issuance of the pre-contract cost agreement. While not legally necessary, prudent business acumen would
dictate, that to the maximum extent possible, agreement on terms and conditions also be established prior to issuance of a
pre-contract cost agreement. Contracting officers should consult with the designated clearance approval authority prior to
agreement on pre-contract costs. The contracting officer should incorporate the pre-contract cost agreement into any resultant

unjustified markings affixed to IP deliverables).
(c) Prior to making a final decision on a claim or termination for default (including a termination for cause under FAR
Part 12), the contracting officer must refer the proposed final decision to the cognizant legal office for legal advice, ADR
suitability, and appropriate dispute resolution strategies. The contracting officer, with the assistance of the cognizant legal
office, must seek review by AF/JACQ of all proposed final decisions. At the same time, the contracting officer must provide
SAF/GCR with any proposed final decision on a claim involving PEO programs and any proposed final decision on a claim
greater than $500,000. The contracting officer or the referring person must promptly notify SAF/GCR and their SCO with all
known information relating to any recommended termination for default.
(d) The contracting officer must use ADR to the maximum extent practicable to resolve a Department of the Air Force
affirmative contract claim (such as defective pricing, liquidated damages, etc.) when unassisted negotiations reach an impasse
as determined by the SCO. The contracting officer must provide to AF/JACQ, with a copy to SAF/GCR, any audit or other
findings indicating Department of the Air Force entitlement torecovery greater than $500,000 where unassisted negotiations
have reached an impasse, in order to develop a dispute resolution strategy. Government claims must be formally asserted
[issuance of a Contracting Officer’s Final Decision (FAR33.206)]within 6 years after the accrual of the claim.
5333.291 Appeals to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA)

notice was received. If the contractor files an appeal with the contracting officer instead of the ASBCA, the contracting
officer must immediately notify AF/JACQ of the date the appeal was received and forward to AF/JACQ and the cognizant
legal office a copy of the appeal and a copy of the envelope in which the appeal was received. The contracting officer must
forward the original appeal and envelope to AF/JACQ, which will then forward the appeal and envelope to the ASBCA, as
necessary.
(c) The contracting officer must prepare a “Rule 4 file” for any appeal to the ASBCA in accordance with Rule 4 of the
ASBCA rules (see DFARS Appendix A, Part 2). The contracting officer must consult with AF/JACQ before including in
the Rule 4 file any legal opinions or intra-governmental or inter-governmental documents as described in DoD Directive
5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, and FAR 24.2.

Subpart 5337.1 – SERVICE CONTRACTS (GENERAL)
5337.102-70 Prohibition on Contracting for Firefighting or Security-Guard Functions
(a)(S-90) For purposes of complying with 10 U.S.C. 2465, which prohibits the DoD from “entering into a contract for
the performance of firefighting or security-guard functions at any military installation or facility,” the term security guard
functions should be understood to mean those functions which are the responsibility of an installation commander or stand-
alone military facility commander. If there is no military commander, this prohibition shall apply to the senior DoD civilian
at the location. The prohibited security guard functions include: performing or supervising protective services work that
involves the protection of federally owned or leased buildings and property at the installation level or at a stand-alone
military facility; protecting government equipment and material at the installation level or at a stand-alone military facility;
controlling access to federal installations by employees, visitors, residents and patients; and monitoring of intrusion detection
systems. The statutory prohibition on contracting for security guard functions in 10 U.S.C. 2465 does not apply to security
support functions that a unit or organization performs as part of security in depth at a location or area on an installation,
or performs within a stand-alone building, so long as the commander and their unit is not responsible for installation-
level security or overall security at a stand-alone military facility. Contractors performing security support functions may
not engage in any law enforcement functions, i.e., criminal investigative work, the preservation of peace; the prevention,
detection and investigation of crimes; the arrest or apprehension of violators; and the provision of assistance to citizens in
emergency situations, including the protection of civil rights, preservation of crime scenes; issuances of citations; and arrests
and apprehensions of suspects.

modifications resulting from an engineering change proposal with a contractor listed on the Contractor Responsibility Watch
List (CRWL) without obtaining SSC/CC approval (see DAFFARS 5309.103(b)(i)).
5343.102 Policy
If the contract is a space program contract to which SSCI 64-101 applies, contracting officers shall not execute contract
modifications resulting from an engineering change proposal with a contractor listed on the Contractor Responsibility Watch
List (CRWL) without obtaining SSC/CC approval (see  DAFFARS 5309.103(b)(i) ).
5343.102-90 Contract Scope Considerations
Contracting officers shall document scope determinations when modifying contracts (see the Scope Determination – MFR
template). New work requires competition unless one of the seven exceptions to competition found in FAR 6.302 applies.
When determining whether proposed modifications constitute new work the following should be considered-
(a) the extent of any changes in the type of work, performance period, and costs between the modification and the original
contract;
(b) whether the original solicitation adequately advised offerors of the potential for the change or the change was the type
that reasonably could have been anticipated; and
(c) whether the modification materially changes the field of competition for the requirement.
For unilateral modifications authorized by clauses other than the Changes clause (e.g., Property clause, Options clause,
Suspension of Work, etc. (see FAR 43.103(b)(3)), a scope determination is not required to be documented but is highly
encouraged.

MP5301.602-2 (d) Designation, Assignment, and Responsibilities of a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)
The following are mandatory procedures (MP) for standardizing the Department of the Air Force (DAF) contracting
process regarding designation, assignment, and responsibilities of a Contracting Officer’s Representative. The assignment
of a COR is not necessary when the CO retains or delegates surveillance to DCMA, or for one of the categories of services
exempted in  DAFI 63-138 Acquisition of Services . DoDI5000.72 requires COs to designate a COR for Construction
contracts, unless the contracting officer retains and executes contract oversight responsibilities when the conditions of
DFARS 201.602-2 exist.
In accordance with DFARS PGI 201.602-2(d)(v), contracting officers must designate a COR for all service contracts, and
supply contracts with cost-reimbursable line items including both firm-fixed-price and other than firm-fixed-price contracts
within 3 business days of contract award unless an exemption applies. See DFARS PGI 201.602-2(d)(v)(A) and (B) for
exemptions.
1.0 Contracting Officer Roles and Responsibilities
1.1 As part of the acquisition planning process, the CO must determine the nature of the work/requirement (Type A, B, or
C) as specified in DoDI 5000.72, DoD Standard for Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) Certification.
1.2 If the requiring activity has not yet initiated a COR nomination, the CO must initiate the Request for COR Support to
notify the requiring activity of the need for COR(s) support and to prompt requiring activity nomination of a qualified COR
via the Joint Appointment Module (JAM) (formerly CORT Tool) in Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE).
1.2.1 The Request for COR Support memorandum initiated by the CO should be routed through requiring activity (e.g.,
COR Supervisor, Functional Commander/Director (FC/FD)). See Enclosure 5 of DoDI 5000.72, Qualification Requirements
for CORs and Enclosure 6 of DoDI 5000.72, Examples of COR Responsibilities and COR Certification Requirements. The
COR must file the CO’s Request for COR Support memorandum (if used) in the “COR Online File.”

training may not be waived.
1.2.3 The CO shall perform, with participation of the COR and COR supervisor, a yearly administrative review of the
COR's online file during the anniversary month of appointment, or more often, at the discretion of the CO. The CO shall
upload the COR File Annual Checklist to the Surveillance and Performance Monitoring (SPM) (Formerly CORT Tool) in
PIEE comprised of the minimum requirements of, COR-related documents necessary for the effective discharge of COR
duties and responsibilities. The Checklist (available in SPM) shall guide the COR in populating the online COR File and
serve as the basis for the CO to judge the accuracy and completeness of the COR file during each review. 1.2.4
1.2.4 The COR Designation from the CO must also:
(a) Designate the COR (if required) as an Assessing Official Representation (AOR) supporting the CPAR process;
(b) Stipulate that the COR will be required to have access to the Synchronized Pre-Deployment &Operation Tracker
(SPOT) (if required due to overseas deployment support); and
(c) Stipulate whether the COR will require access to the System for Award Management (SAM) to review the
contractor's service contract reports.
1.2.5 Notification of COR designation should be provided to the QAPC.
1.2.6. Distribution of the fully executed COR designation must be made to the COR, COR Supervisor, Contractor, and
Property administrator. In addition, notification must be sent to the local Judge Advocate General office or Office of General
Counsel immediately upon the appointment of a COR designated as an OGE Form 450 filer, and annually by January 1st.
1.3 CO, Contract Specialist, or QAPC Led Training. The CO must ensure contract-specific training is scheduled and
provided to the prospective COR, unless waived (see 1.2.2). The training may be conducted by the CO, Contracting
Specialist, or QAPC, and must consist of the following at a minimum prior to contract award:
1.3.1 Duties/responsibilities to be delegated;
1.3.2 Importance of COR performance;
1.3.3 Personal conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest;
1.3.4 Unauthorized commitments;
1.3.5 Ethics/integrity in relationships with the CO, COR management (e.g., COR Supervisor, Services Designated

1.3.6 Discussion of the  Seven Steps to the Services Acquisition Process .
1.3.7 Contract-specific training consisting as a minimum of the following:
1.3.7.1 A discussion of the contract (SOW, PWS, Specifications, etc.), and surveillance plan/QASP;
1.3.7.2 An awareness of any areas in the contract susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse;
1.3.7.3 Creation, maintenance, and submission of all surveillance documentation and contractor performance
assessment information required by the contract and applicable regulations;
1.3.7.4 How the COR can stay abreast of contract modifications;
1.3.7.5 How the COR can monitor contract fund status; and,
1.3.7.6 Joint CO and COR review of the “COR File Annual Checklist” to ensure mutual understanding of the level/
quality of surveillance and documentation must be maintained in the on-line SPM file.
1.3.8 Refer to the Suggested Contract-Specific Training Syllabus template for conducting contract-specific training.
The template may be tailored to fit your acquisition.
COR Performance and Appraisal
1.4 At a minimum, the CO and COR supervisor must review the COR’s reports, files, and other documentation for
completeness/accomplishment, on an annual basis.
1.5 The CO must provide an annual assessment, as a minimum, on the COR’s performance to the COR supervisor. The
assessment may be performed concurrently with the administrative review of the COR online file detailed in 1.2.3.
1.6 The COR must complete and upload reports to the SPM, as required, to enable the CO to review and approve/ reject
reports in the SPM.
1.7 When the CO terminates the COR’s duties (see Termination of COR Designation), a new COR can be nominated
prior to terminating the former COR. The requiring activity must nominate a COR replacement via the JAM to ensure
continuous contract monitoring by a qualified individual. Copies of the designation for the successor COR will have the same
distribution requirements as the COR letter of designation.

MP5301.603-90 Selection, Appointment, and Termination of Appointment of Contracting Officers
(a) Applicability. This MP must be used when selecting, nominating, appointing, and terminating contracting officers
(CO) to maximize standardization across the AF. Warrants are issued in accordance with FAR 1.603, DFARS 201.603,
10 U.S.C. § 1724 , DODI 5000.66 , and this MP. Warrants may only be issued for the following values: zero-dollar
(administrative warrant for accomplishing zero-dollar, administrative actions only), Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT),
$5M, $25M, and unlimited. See MP5301.601(a)(i) for identification of the appointing official with the authority to issue and
terminate Contracting Officer warrants.
For any DAF military members under administrative control (ADCON) of AFDW and assigned to non-DAF organizations
(e.g. DAU, DCMA, DCAA, etc.), the AFICC/CC SCO will serve as the warranting authority.
The authority limitations of this MP do not apply to administrative terminations (for retirement or separation) or
administrative documentation relating to warrant transfers. Authority to sign this documentation is delegable to no lower than
the COCO, the Chief of the Clearance and Program Support Division, or Chief of Policy.
(b) Warranting. An individual selected for contracting officer appointment must be a military member in Air Force
Specialty Code (AFSC) 64PX or 6C0X1 or a civilian in the GS-1102 occupational series who occupies a manned
authorization listed under these specialty codes/series, and complies with the requirements at DFARS 201.603-2 and this MP.
(c) Focal Point (FP). FPs must be designated in writing via the FP designation form and may be assigned unlimited or
limited duties as indicated in the Warrant Process Focal Point Designation Form . Each SCO is responsible for appointing FPs
and must designate at least one FP with full duties. SCOs may delegate authority to appoint limited FPs to the COCO. This
authority is not further delegable. Follow the form instructions when appointing FPs.
(d) AF CO Warrant Tracking Tool. All warrants are entered into and tracked via the AF CO Warrant Tracking Tool
(AFCOWTT). FPs obtain access to the AFCOWTT by submitting a copy of the Warrant Process Focal Point Designation
Form to HQ AFMC/PK. Prior to obtaining access, FPs must request training on the use of the AFCOWTT by contacting
-70
Revised June 12, 2024
2.0 COR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
MP5301.603-90
HQ AFMC/PK, as applicable. FPs are responsible for entering all warrant data into the tool, and for uploading warrants
(SF1402s) (and up to three past SF1402s), a copy of the Contracting Officer Test (COT) certificate, and the Contracting
Officer Appointment/Warrant Eligibility Transfer/Termination Request (COWER). FPs also administer all other warrant
actions and are responsible for maintaining current, accurate, and complete warrant data in the AFCOWTT, including
ensuring that allmandatory attachments are uploaded for each warrant holder, including the SF-1402, the COT certificate,
and a copy of the completed COWER. A new warrant threshold requires a new warrant number; If a new warrant is obtained
(for example, someone’s warrant threshold is increased from $5M to $25M, or someone obtains an Unlimited Warrant where
a Limited Warrant was previously held), a new Warrant Number will be assigned. The old warrant will be placed in an
“Inactive” status and the new warrant with new Warrant Number will be created and set to “Active” status. A new warrant
number is not necessary in the case of someone changing their official name with no change to their warrant threshold;
administrative changes do not require a new warrant number.
(e) CO Warrant Nomenclature. All transferable warrants shall list “Department of the Air Force” on the ‘Organization’
and ‘Agency/Department’ lines of the SF1402. All transferable warrants are numbered as follows: the first two positions
are “AF”, the third and fourth positions are the last two digits of the fiscal year (FY) in which the appointment is made, and
positions 5-9 are obtained from the identification (ID) field of the AFCOWTT; for example, in FY21 an ID field number of
12345 would yield an appointment number of AF-21-12345. Current transferable warrants will be updated through attrition.
All new non-transferable warrants will be numbered as follows: Organization-FY-XXXXX e.g., SSC-21-12499 for SSC; last
5 positions are obtained from the ID field of the AFCOWTT.
(f) Nominating Warrant Candidates. Warrant candidates are nominated by a candidate sponsor who shall be no lower than
the candidate’s first level supervisor. Submit warrant nominations to the designated FP using the COWER.
(g) Contracting Officer Test. Candidates for warrants above the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) must pass the two-
hour timed, open book COT by achieving a minimum score of 80%.
(1) The COT is a proctored, computer-generated test containing 25 randomly selected true/false and multiple-choice
questions from the FAR, DFARS, and/or DAFFARS. Each question is worth up to two points.
(2) During the COT, candidates are limited to the use of electronic regulations available via www.acquisition.gov  and
hard copies of the FAR and DFARS (free of tabs and notes); however, hard copies will not be provided. Notes and electronic
devices are not permitted in the testing site. Use of email, instant messaging, or any other form of electronic communication
is prohibited during the COT.
(3) Candidates must provide the correct answer and the correct, associated complete reference (e.g., FAR 15.401(a)(2)
(i)(B)), in order to earn two points. If the candidate answers the question correctly but provides an incorrect reference, one
point will be received. If the candidate answers the question incorrectly but the reference correctly, the candidate will not
receive any points as this indicates a failure to understand the regulation. The COT is automatically and electronically scored.
i. If the candidate fails to pass the COT, the candidate may challenge missed questions and/or references in
accordance with the Proctor User Guide only when approval of the challenge would result in a passing score. (NOTE: Access
to the guide is restricted to warrant focal points.)
ii. A candidate who fails the COT may retake it if authorized by their immediate supervisor and space is available. If
the candidate fails to pass the COT on the second attempt, the candidate may not retake the COT until a three-month waiting
period has passed.
iii. Supervisors are authorized to approve a maximum of two continuous learning points per 12-month period for an
individual who completes the COT, whether for a warrant request action or for training purposes.
(4) Practice COT: A practice test titled Contracting Officer Demo Test - C10979 was developed to help familiarize
warrant candidates with the question structure of the COT. The practice test is available via the myLearning site. It is a
non-proctored, 50-minute, timed test consisting of ten questions which are electronically and randomly selected from a 20-
question pool. There is no limit on the number of times the practice COT may be taken. The completion of a practice test
shall not be used as the basis for warrant eligibility.
(h) Warrant Boards. Warrant boards are reserved exclusively for warrants exceeding $25M and are used to further assess
the candidate’s experience, qualifications, communication skills, and overall demeanor.
(1) Warrant boards must be chaired by the appointing official or designee at a level no lower than:
i. Deputy Director or Assistant Director of Contracting;
ii. Technical Director/Assistant to the Director of Contracting;
(2) Warrant boards must have a minimum of five members, including the board chairperson, participating to constitute
a quorum. Suggested board composition includes:
i. Contracting office supervisors;
-71

DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
ii. Representative from the staff judge advocate office;
iii. Competition Advocate;
iv. Clearance/program support procurement analyst;
v. Small business specialist/liaison;
vi. Supervisors/Directors/Deputy Directors from other disciplines; and/or
vii. Cost/Price Analyst
(3) Warrant board members may be held in person by teleconference, or video conference at the discretion of the board
chairperson.
(4) The warrant candidate must correctly answer and/or discuss no fewer than 10 questions, seven of which must
be obtained from the scenario-based AF question repository. To obtain access to the question repository, submit the
Warrant Process Focal Point Designation Form to HQ AFMC/PK. The appointing official has the discretion to develop
new questions(s) for the remaining three questions, which may be scenario- or knowledge-based. The board shall include
questions that address PEO, Enterprise, and Operational portfolios, as well as pricing, fiscal law, contract law, legal, and
problem solving.
(5) The appointing official (See Section a), in consultation with the board members, may appoint an unlimited warrant,
a limited warrant, or none. Individuals awarded an unlimited warrant as a result of a warrant board shall not be required to sit
before the board again, except in the case of a reappointment after a termination for cause (See Para. (s)).
(i) Unlimited Warrants. Unlimited warrants require a minimum of two years of contracting experience, a baccalaureate
degree, successful completion of the COT and passing a warrant board. Additionally, unlimited warrant candidates, at a
minimum, shall possess the DoD Contracting Professional Certification (Back-to-Basics) or legacy DAWIA Contracting
certification. All unlimited warrants are transferable across the AF.
(j) Limited Transferable Warrants. Warrants limited by a monetary threshold are transferable across the DAF. A Limited
Warranted CO shall not sign contract documents associated with award, to include RFPs and D&Fs, above the dollarized
warrant limitation. Dollarized warrant limitations apply to all contract award documentation and to the value of the instant
contract action a CO isexecuting. For example, if a CO holds a limited warrant of $5M and the contract award amount of the
instant action is $6M, the CO is not authorized to sign the contract action.
(1) For zero-dollar and SAT limited warrants, contracting personnel (including purchasing agents in theGS-1105 series)
must have at least one year of contracting experience.
(2) For $5M limited warrants, contracting personnel must have a minimum of two years of contracting experience,
DoD Contracting Professional Certification (i.e., successful completion of the Contracting Certification Exam at DAU) or
legacy DAWIA Contracting certification (Level I, II, or III), and have successfully completed the COT. Warrant boards shall
not be convened for warrants within this threshold.
(3) For $25M limited warrants, contracting personnel must have a minimum oftwo years of contracting experience,
DoD Contracting Professional Certification (i.e., successful completion of the Contracting Certification Exam at DAU)
or legacy DAWIA Contracting certification (Level I, II, or III), successfulcompletion of the COT, and vetting process
established by the appointing official and documented on the COWER. Warrant boards shall not be convened for warrants
within this threshold.
(k) Local National (LN) Warrants. LNs in an equivalent occupational series to GS-1102 may be selected for a contracting
officer appointment in accordance with this MP. LN candidates for zero-dollar and SAT limited warrants must meet the same
requirements for zero dollar and SAT warrants described in para (j)(1). LN candidates for $5M and $25M limited warrants
must have successfully completed the COT, possess a baccalaureate degree and a minimum of two years of contracting
experience, and shall complete all contracting courses required for DoD Contracting Professional Certification (LNs do not
have access to the system for the certification portion) or shall possess legacy DAWIA Contracting certification (Level I, II,
or III). LN Unlimited Warrant candidates must meet all of the requirements described in this paragraph for $5M and $25M
limited LN Warrants and must also pass a warrant board. All LN Warrants are non-transferable.
(l) Contingency Contracting Force. In accordance with 10 USC 1724 and DODI 5000.66, a member of the contingency
contracting force in AFSC 6C0X1 and 6C000 who do not possess a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution may
be nominated, evaluated, and selected for a zero dollar (administrative warrant for accomplishing zero-dollar, administrative
actions only), SAT, $5M, or $25M limited warrant provided that the individual meets all other requirements for the warrant
type and dollar value described in paragraph (j). Since all active duty enlisted members of the DAF Contracting AFSCs
6C0X1 and 6C000 who are serving in an Air Force acquisition coded position are members of the Contingency Contracting
Force, regardless of the place of duty performance or the position held, there is no need to issue a separate Contingency

2.0 COR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
MP5301.603-90
Contracting Officer warrant. Military and Civilian personnel with an active DAF warrant may use their existing warrant in
support of both non-contingency and Contingency Operations.
(m) Non-Transferable Warrants. Non-transferable warrants may be issued for specific functions or buying activities
(e.g., contract closeout, defective pricing actions, funding modifications, administrative modifications, specific contracts,
units, etc.) Candidates for zero-dollar and SAT warrants must meet the same requirements for the warrant type and dollar
value described in paragraph (j)(1). Candidates for limited non-transferable warrants valued at $5M must meet the same
requirements for the warrant type and dollar value described in paragraph (j)(2); however, in the case of a non-transferable
$5M warrant limited strictly to incremental funding-only and/or admin-only actions, passage of the COT is recommended
but not required. Candidates for limited non-transferable warrants valued at $25M must meet the same requirements for
the warrant type and dollar value described in paragraph (j)(3). The SF1402 must clearly state “Limited Non-Transferable
Warrant” and cite the specific warrant limitations.
(n) Warrant Transfer and Reinstatement.
(1) Warrants issued in accordance with this MP, except for those issued in accordance with paragraphs (l) and (m)
above, are transferable across the DAF. As long as a warrant is in good standing, an individual shall not be required to test
or board again. However, warrant transferability does not guarantee immediate utilization, as the gaining appointing official
(see paragraph (g)(1)) may determine that time is needed to facilitate familiarity with new workload responsibilities and
organizational procedures. When a Contracting Officer moves from one organization to another, the losing organization’s FP
shall change the affected warrant record to Inactive and annotate any pertinent information in the notes. The gaining FP shall
review the incoming Contracting Officer’s warrant record to ensure it is current, accurate, complete, and in good standing.
Further instructions regarding electronically transferring a warrant to a new organization are located in the AFCOWTT.
(2) Warrant reinstatement is applicable to an individual who previously held an AF warrant and whose warrant was
subsequently terminated for reasons such as reassignment or resignation. A request to reinstate an AF warrant must be
submitted to the appointing official for approval through the designated FP using the COWER. The appointing official shall
document their assessment and rationale for warrant reinstatement on the COWER.
(o) Grandfathered Contracting Officers. Current COs are not required to be tested, boarded, or reappointed as a result of
the issuance of, or changes to, this MP; however, those with limited non- transferable or limited transferable warrants must
meet the requirements of this MP to obtain a transferable and/or higher dollar value warrant.
(p) Warrants Issued Based on External Warrant Credentials. A new AF 1102 with external, federal government CO
experience may be issued an DAF warrant without meeting the requirements of this MP (COT and vetting process or warrant
board) based on the discretion of the appointing official, provided they meet the qualification requirements at DFARS
201.603-2. The appointing official must conduct an assessment of the candidate’s qualifications and experience prior to the
issuance of a DAF warrant. The appointing official shall document the rationale for appointment on the COWER (See sample
criteria.)
(q) Warrant Reciprocity. In December 2023, the Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force and the Army(Acquisition,
Technology, and Logistics) signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), Cross-Service Contingency Warranting
Procedures,between the two Departments. This MOA, which expires in December 2033, established a warrant reciprocity
relationship during contingency operations as defined in l 0 U.S.C. § l01(a)(13), or in support of an emergency or major
disaster as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 5122, or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense in support of U.S. government-
led operations (hereinafter, "contingency operations"). The MOA mandates recognition of cross-service warrants and
qualifications for both military and civilian personnel and requires each services’ Head of the Contracting Activity (or
delegated warranting authority) to recognize cross-service warrants and the qualifications and thresholds identified therein
without additional testing, assessments, or issuinga new warrant. The intent of this MOA is to enable the lead Service for a
contingency operation to avoid delays in providing expeditionary contracting support.
(r) Reissuance of Warrant Certificates. A request to reissue an existing warrant certificate for administrative purposes
(e.g., damage to or deterioration of the original SF1402, name changes, etc.) is not a new appointment and may be submitted
directly to the FP for processing to the appropriate appointing official; use of the COWER is not required. (s)
(s) Warrant Suspension or Termination for Cause. Warrants may be suspended or terminated for unsatisfactory
performance. The appointing official may suspend a warrant in writing until proficiency is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the appointing official. If a warrant is terminated for cause, the candidate must be reappointed in accordance with paragraphs
(i), (j), or (k) of this MP, to include a warrant board for reappointment of an unlimited warrant.
(t) Contracting Officer’s Signature. The Contracting Officer’s wet and digital signature must match the name listed on the
SF1402, as should the Contracting Officer’s signature block.

The following mandatory procedure is provided for preparing 1279 Reports under DFARS 205.303 and Reports of Intent
to Award multiyear contracts under DAFFARS 5317.170.
(a)(i) The 1279 Report is used for Congressional notification and public announcement of contract awards that exceed the
DoD threshold. Use the 1279 Report Format in (d), tailored where appropriate, when preparing Reports of Intent to Award
IAW DAFFARS 5317.170. It is important to note that the Notice of Intent to Award IAW DAFFARS 5317.170 does not
satisfy the requirement for a 1279 Report.
(ii) Alternate 1279 reporting for the announcement of source selection contract awards. If the awardee information
cannot be provided three days in advance, the report does not need to identify the offeror that has been selected for award.
Insert “Source Selection Information - Will Advise” for “Contractor Data” and either "$50 million or above" or "below $50
million" for “Face Value” and “Funding Data”. When using these procedures, provide the successful offeror, face value of
the award, and funding data to SAF/LLW  no later than 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date. If SAF/
LLW is not notified by 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date, announcement of the award may need
to be delayed.
(b) After a 1279 Report has been submitted, report any changes in plans promptly to SAF/LLW.
(c) When immediate award is required and advance notification under paragraph (a) above was not accomplished, prepare
the 1279 Report as usual and send it to SAF/LLW. Include the justification for immediate award. If the Congressional
and public announcement cannot be made the same day as the award, the contracting officer must obtain the contractor’s
agreement to withhold public announcement of the award until the award is posted on https://www.defense.gov/News/
Contracts/. Include in the report a statement that this non-disclosure agreement has been made. The contracting officer will
notify the contractor of the agreed upon date of public announcement. The award may then be made without the three-day
coordination.

MP5315.3 Source Selection
1 PURPOSE, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES
1.1 Purpose
This Mandatory Procedure (MP) establishes supplemental procedures for conducting competitively negotiated source
selections of $10M or more within the Department of the Air Force (DAF), and follows the numbering convention of the
DOD Source Selection Procedures, dated 20 August 2022.
1.2 Applicability and Waivers
This MP must be used in conjunction with FAR Part 15,as supplemented, to include the DFARS Part 215 and its
companion resource entitled Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI), DoD Source Selection Procedures, and related
laws, regulation, and policy. As guidance, this MP also provides hyperlinks to non-mandatory best practices, TTPs, sample
RFP and contract language, tailorable templates and training materials.
1.2.3 Waivers. Waivers for solicitations valued at $1B or more for approval by the Director, Defense Pricing,
Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (DPCAP), must be forwarded through the SCO to the cognizant HCA Workflow for
review and processing. See MP 5301.601(a)(i) for the waiver approval authority when the solicitation value is above $10M
but less than $1B. For waivers pertaining to SSAC establishment, SCOs should consider input from the SSA.
1.2.4.1.Waiver procedures apply only to the DoD Source Selection Procedures (CAUTION: read paragraph 1.2
of the DOD Source Selection Procedures) and this MP. The requirements of FAR15.3,as supplemented, cannot be waived as
these requirements are subject to the FAR deviation process (see DAFFARS 5301.402(2), DAFFARS 5301.403(1)(i), (ii),and
DAFFARS 5301.404(b)(i) and (ii).
1.2.6 Acquisitions with an estimated dollar value less than or equal to $50M may use price as the only evaluation
factor and, therefore, be exempt from the DoD Source Selection Procedures, dated 20August 2022, and from this MP, if all of
the following conditions are met:
(1) The requirement is non-complex and well-defined, such that consideration of non-cost/price evaluation factors
(e.g., technical, past performance, etc.) would not provide any meaningful differentiation amongst proposals and would add
no value to the selection of a successful offeror;
(2) Past performance record and history will be assessed as one of the multiple standards required fora successful
offeror to be determined responsible as described in FAR 9.104;
(3) Use of price as the only evaluation factor is the most advantageous approach to the government;and
(4) The acquisition strategy approving official has determined that use of price as the only evaluation factor is the
most appropriate source selection methodology for the requirement and the justification for this determination is included in
the approved acquisition strategy/plan.
1.2.6.1 See MP5301.601(a)(1) for acquisitions with an estimated dollar value over $50M that meet the conditions
at 1.2.6 (1)-(4).

1.4.1.2 SSA Responsibilities. In addition to the responsibilities listed in FAR 15.303(b), DFARS 215.303(b)
(2),and the DOD Source Selection Procedures, the SSA shall:
1.4.1.2.3 Be accessible to the PCO, SSEB Chairperson and SSAC Chairperson (if applicable) to ensure that
necessary leadership and guidance is provided to the SST. Promote active communication within the SST and encourage the
team to raise concerns/issues.
1.4.1.2.6 See the following tailorable templates:
1.4.1.2.6.1  Source Selection Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA   )  . An NDA may be executed on an
annual basis in accordance with DAFFARS 5303.104-4(a).
1.4.1.2.6.2 Conflict of Interest Statement.
1.4.2 PCO.
1.4.2.2 PCO Responsibilities. In addition to the responsibilities listed in FAR 15.303(c) and the DoD Source
Selection Procedures, the PCO shall:
1.4.2.2.2 Consider sample RFP Section L language for Use of Non-Government Advisors, when applicable.
1.4.2.2.3 Manage all source selection documents, control and record all exchanges with offerors, and
protect all documents (see Section 4). Consider identifying a Source Selection Records Custodian (SSRC) familiar with
the contracting process to manage all source selection documents (PCO or someone under PCO oversight). Ensure source
selection material is not removed, circulated, or disseminated outside of the source selection work area without PCO review
and approval. Ensure all means of electronic communications receive additional scrutiny to preclude inadvertent release of
documents that contain sensitive or embedded source selection files. It is a good practice that prior to transmission of Source
Selection Information to offerors via any means, the information is reviewed by a second person to preclude inadvertent
inclusion of inappropriate data. Additionally, Source Selection Information transmitted to offerors electronically (e.g., via
email or disc) or posted to a website must be distributed in a “locked” format, such as scanned .pdf file, .jpeg file, or other
protected format, unless offerors are required to fill-in or complete portions of a document, such as Section K Representations
and Certifications, or a pricing matrix. Using e-mail to transmit source selection information should be done judiciously
and it must be encrypted and digitally signed. Include in the subject line the phrase “Source Selection Information – See
FAR2.101 and3.104”. Use the Source Selection Information Cover Sheet to identify source selection information. A sample
Verification of Correspondence Going to Offeror checklist may be utilized, as desired.
1.4.2.2.4 Maintain in the official contract file (whether in hard copy or electronic media) all evaluation
material and any related supporting information, including minority and dissenting opinions, that has been presented in any
form to the SSA as an official record that must not be altered. Updates, revisions, or changes to that evaluation information
must be captured in subsequent documentation such that the original record remains distinct.
1.4.2.2.4.1 Working papers, calculations, and personal notes must be clearly identified as such and are not
normally part of the official source selection record unless they include information relevant to the source selection decision
and the information has not been captured in the official record. Solicit the advice of legal counsel and representatives from
the Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE) (if used) regarding the management and/or retention determination of any paper
or digital document generated during the source selection. Legal counsel, the SSEB Chair, SSRC (if other than the PCO)
and the PCO must review any notes, working papers, and other documents for a retention determination at regular intervals
during the source selection process and upon completion.
1.4.2.2.4.2 Preserve documents and data that are not stored within the electronic official contract filing
system (e.g., classified documents, product samples, electronic media) as part of the official record and identify their physical
location. A sample Source Selection File Checklist may be tailored for use, as desired.
1.4.2.2.4.3 Ensure that any requests for source selection delegations are properly accomplished and
documented in the source selection file.

1.4.2.2.7 Send a notice to all appropriate organizations (e.g., user or requirements personnel, public affairs
offices, etc., that could be contacted by offerors or media outlets concerning the requirement or acquisition) concurrent with
issuance of the solicitation announcing that a source selection is in progress. For acquisitions estimated at $100M or more,
send the notice to the cognizant HCA Workflow for HAF-level notification. The notice shall:
1) identify the system, subsystem, service, or project involved;
2) identify the anticipated period of the source selection activities;
3) include a statement to the effect that contacts or briefings concerning the program by industry are no longer
allowed outside of the formal source selection process; and
4) state that the PCO (include name and phone number) controls all contact or exchanges with industry/
offerors and is the only person authorized to release source selection information before and after contract award.
A tailorable template for Notice Announcing that a Source Selection is in Progress is available for use, if
desired.
1.4.2.2.12 Post  source selection lessons learned no later than 90 days after contract award or termination/
cancellation of the source selection.
1.43 SSAC.
1.4.3.2 SSAC Composition.
1.4.3.2.1 It is preferable that the SSAC Chairperson not be in the chain of command of the SSA.
1.4.3.2.2 For all new Milestone B (Pre-MDAP on Major Defense Acquisition Program lists) ACAT I and II
competitive acquisitions, the specific composition of the SSAC should consist of senior leaders (flag rank or 0-6/GS-15/
NH-04 to the maximum extent practicable) from Program Management, Engineering, Finance, Legal, Contracting, Small
Business, the ACE, and any other participants as determined appropriate by the SSA, who have recent experience in the
successful conduct of source selections. For all other acquisitions when an SSAC is used, the specific composition of the
SSAC is at the discretion of the SSA, based upon the expertise required to accomplish a successful source selection. The
SSAC may be augmented with senior leaders from the SAF/AQ or SAF/SQ staff, when appropriate, to provide additional
experience and expertise. The SSAC may also be supplemented by other subject matter experts at comparable functional
positions.
1.44 SSEB.
1.4.4.4 SSEB Responsibilities.
1.4.4.4.1.7 It is considered a best practice for the Program Manager (PM), when one is assigned, to serve as
the SSEB Chairperson. It is also a best practice that the SSEB chair not serve in multiple roles.
1.4.4.4.3 For source selections without an SSAC, the SSEB Chairperson must document in the source
selection plan, whether or not the SSA wants the SSEB to perform the comparative analysis of proposals and provide that
analysis and an award recommendation in the SSEB Final Report.
1.4.6 Other Advisor’s.
1.4.6.1 Government Advisor’s. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and international cooperative project
partners may only participate in the source selection process as advisor’s. The PCO must not disclose to the FMS customer
any form of cost or price data that is proprietary unless the offeror authorizes its release.
1.4.6.2.2 Limitations on use of nongovernment advisor’s. Nongovernment advisor’s shall not attend the past
performance portion of evaluation briefings
2 PRE-SOLICITATION ACTIVITIES
2.1 Conduct Acquisition Planning
2.2 Develop a Source Selection Plan (SSP)
The PCO and the SSEB chair, with assistance from SSEB members, as necessary, prepare the SSP. A Source Selection
Plantemplate is available for use, if desired.
2.2.5 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors. When using VATEP, address the decision to use, or not use, an affordability cap,
along with supporting rationale for the decision. If an affordability cap will be used, describe how it will be evaluated and
whether offerors whose proposals exceed the affordability cap will be eligible for award.
2.2.6 Documentation. Briefing charts shall not serve as the SSEB Initial Report, Competitive Range Decision Document,
updated SSEB Initial Report, or SSEB Final Report, but may be used to present summaries of these reports to the SSA. If
briefing charts are used to comply with any other source selection documentation requirements set forth in the DoD Source
-3
Revised June 12, 2024
2.3
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
Selection Procedures, a written script for each briefing must be maintained in the official (permanent) contract file. Briefings
should summarize the evaluation and not duplicate the content of written reports.
2.2.9 Securing Source Selection Materials. Section 9.0 of the SSP (“Securing Source Selection Materials”) must include
a plan and procedures which address the filing, protection, handling, maintenance, release, retention and disposition of all
documents that constitute the complete source selection record. For those source selections utilizing an electronic system
for source selection documentation, the SSP must include the process for handling documentation, such as the process for
documenting the basis for any changes made to an evaluator’s finalized document. The plan must address training for all SST
members to familiarize them with the plan/procedures and mechanism(s) to ensure compliance with the plan/procedures.
2.2.10 The PCO shall maintain the SSP after approval. Subsequent proposed changes to the source selection organization,
to include the SSEB and the SSAC (when used), shall be documented in an addendum to the SSP and approved by the SSA
unless the SSA delegates this approval responsibility to the SSEB Chairperson within the SSP.
2.3 Develop the Request for Proposals
2.3.1 Evaluation Factors/Subfactors. RFPSection L and M samples are available for use, as desired.
2.3.4.1 Cost or Price. The analysis technique(s) identified in FAR 15.404,as supplemented, for the evaluation of the
proposed cost or price shall be included in the evaluation criteria (Section M or equivalent provisions of the solicitation for
commercial acquisitions).
2.3.4.1.1 When used, the Probable Cost estimate is the government estimate of the cost to acquire specified goods
and/or services based on each offeror’s proposed approach. The Probable Cost is based upon an analysis of each offeror’s
unique proposal in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). Define all the components that make up the aggregate government
Probable Cost and specify them in Section M (or equivalent provisions of the solicitation for commercial acquisitions).
2.3.4.2.4 Affordability Cap. When an affordability cap is established, the affordability cap must be specified in the
RFP and affordability must be included either as a go/no go gate or as an evaluation criterion in the RFP. The RFP must state
whether proposals that exceed the affordability cap can be considered for award.
2.3.6. Requirements that fall within the areas of traditional offeror responsibility factors may trigger the Small Business
Administration Certificate of Competency (CoC) process if such requirements are evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable
basis, as a rating of unacceptable for an otherwise apparently successful business offeror equates to a non-responsibility
determination. For example, issues related to facility clearance/security requirements or evaluation of professional employee
compensation as an element of responsibility are areas that may trigger the CoC process for small business offerors. PCOs
should consult with small business and legal counsel regarding the use and treatment of such evaluation factors/subfactors.
2.4 Release the Request for Proposals (No DAF Text)
3 EVALUATION AND DECISION PROCESS
3.1 Evaluation Activities
3.1.1.5 When FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (Feb 1993), is included in the
RFP, the Government shall evaluate whether all offerors considered for award understand the contract requirements and have
proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements. This evaluation may be accomplished through a technical
subfactor to evaluate offerors’ proposed management approach and or/staffing plan, or including the evaluation under the
cost/price factor or as a “Volume I” proposal submission and element of proposal compliance and offeror responsibility.
3.1.1.5.1 When including the professional employee compensation evaluation as a “Volume I” proposal submission
and element of proposal compliance and offeror responsibility in a source selection with small business offerors, a finding of
non-responsibility due to an inadequate professional employee compensation plan for an otherwise successful small business
offeror requires the PCO to engage the Small Business Administration Certificate of Competency (CoC) process.
3.2 Documentation of Initial Evaluation Results
3.2.1 SSEB Initial Evaluation. The SSEB Initial Report is used to document the results of the SSEB’s initial evaluation.
The rationale for initial evaluation results and assignment of initial ratings will be fully and contemporaneously documented
in the SSEB Initial Report. The SSEB Initial Report shall be signed by the PCO and SSEB Chairperson after the completion
of initial evaluations and prior to presentation of the initial evaluation results to the SSA. The following tailorable templates

3.4 Competitive Range Decision Document
3.4.1 The tailorable  Competitive Range Decision Document (CRDD) template is available for use, as desired.
3.5 Discussion Process
3.5.5 Best Practices. The PCO may provide offerors in the competitive range with their own initial ratings and results
of their own initial pricing analysis or total evaluated price. When interim ratings and pricing analysis are provided prior
to requesting final proposal revisions, the ratings must reflect the results of discussions with the offeror. PCOs may use the
actual briefing charts used to brief the SSA as a method of disclosing an offeror’s ratings and price analysis to them. The
PCO must require offerors to provide proposal change pages along with their EN responses for any aspect of the proposal that
will be incorporated into the awarded contract.
3.5.7 The SSEB Initial Report shall be updated, as necessary, following evaluation of offeror responses to discussions.
The rationale for updated (interim) evaluation results and assignment of updated (interim) ratings will be fully and
contemporaneously documented in the SSEB Initial Report. The updated SSEB Initial Report is reviewed by the SSAC (if
an SSAC is used) and must include, if applicable, any minority and dissenting opinion(s). At a minimum, the report shall be
updated and signed by the PCO and SSEB Chairperson prior to presentation of the pre-Final Proposal Revisions evaluations
and briefing to the SSA.

6 MANDATORY AIR FORCE SOURCE SELECTION TRAINING
6.1 Purpose
This Section establishes and standardizes the mandatory Air Force source selection training process for acquisition/SSTs.
6.2 Responsibilities of Senior Contracting Officials (SCO)
 SCOs must:
(a) implement a robust source selection training program;
(b) designate a Training Manager/Point of Contact (POC);
(c) designate experienced source selection trainers; and
(d) maintain current lists of the Training Managers/POCs for use at their respective locations.
The lists should be updated as necessary, but at a minimum shall be updated annually. A Designation of Source
Selection Training Manager/Trainers template is available for use, as desired.
6.3 Required Training for Designated Trainers
6.3.1 Designated trainers must receive “Train-the-Trainer” training and be certified as source selection trainers. Periodic
“Train-the-Trainer” sessions are conducted by SAF/AQCP personnel every quarter via webinar; however, this training may
be conducted by any SCO-designated and experienced source selection trainer. Note that this is summary-level training
-7
Revised June 12, 2024
6.4
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
designated trainers and not for use by source selection teams and other individuals to satisfy the source selection training
requirements set forth in paragraph 6.4.1.
6.3.2 Training Managers/POCs must maintain a record of the source selection training provided by designated trainers,
including the name of the acquisition, training date, names of individuals trained, and training provided (e.g., Phase I
(Acquisition Planning) or Phase II (Source Selection Execution) training).
6.3.3 6.3.3 Designated trainers who have not participated in “Train-the-Trainer” training within a two (2) year period must
be recertified. Recertification requires that the SCO confirm the individual’s continued designation as a source selection
trainer and that the individual re-complete the “Train-the-Trainer” training.
6.4 Acquisition/Source Selection Team Training
6.4.1 Conducting Source Selection Training Sessions.
Source selection training must be presented to the entire SST, including the SSA, SSAC Chair and members, PM (where
one is assigned), RO,and all advisors. Independent review of source selection training materials by SST members and/or
attendance at “Train-the-Trainer” training is not sufficient to satisfy this training requirement.
Specialized executive level training modules are available for the SSA and SSAC.
Phase I (Acquisition Planning)training should be presented at the earliest stage of an acquisition and covers the acquisition
process up to release of the RFP. If an SST member has participated in Phase I training within 12 months, the SCO may
waive the Phase I training requirement for that member.
Phase II (Source Selection Execution)training is presented prior to or immediately after receipt of proposals.
6.4.2 Training Content and Process.
The SAF/AQCP Knowledge Management Team develops and maintains source selection training modules to assist Source
Selection Trainers. Trainers are encouraged to tailor the modules, as needed, to meet the unique elements of the instant
acquisition.
The Ethics, Procurement Integrity, and Conflicts of Interest topic should be presented by the local legal advisor. Links
to Ethics training material are included in both Phase I and Phase II source selection training materials. The use of locally-
developed Ethics training by local legal advisors is encouraged. The length of the source selection training and the level of
detail presented in either Phase I (Acquisition Planning) or Phase II (Source Selection Execution) depends on the complexity
of the specific acquisition and the experience level of the SST.
6.4.3 Advance Preparation.
Effectiveness of the source selection training experience can be enhanced with advance preparation. The Defense
Acquisition University (DAU) offers continuous learning modules on source selection and related topics. Some suggested
DAU courses include the following:
CON 0040– Market Research
CON 0072 – Source Selection
CLC028 - Past Performance Information
CLC 132 - Organizational Conflicts of Interest
ACQ 0490 - Procurement Fraud Indicators 
6.5 Source Selection Training Material
The Source Selection Training Modules, Trainer’s Lesson Plans, and Resource/Reference Material are accessible by
designated trainers and training managers on SharePoint  here. Additional training materials for teams are available in the
DAFFARS Library, Part 5315.
6.6 Training Certificates.
Any Trainer conducting “Train the Trainer” training will provide a Source Selection Training Certificate to the Training
Managers/POCs and Trainers upon completion of the source selection training. Trainers must provide the Source Selection
Training Certificate for Phase I and Phase II to the personnel they train.
6.7 Source Selection Training Survey.
Following training, personnel are encouraged to complete the  Source Selection Training Survey . The feedback provided
through the survey will enable the SAF/AQCP Knowledge Management Team to gauge the effectiveness of its source
selection training material and obtain suggestions for improvement.

LIST OF TABLES AND FIGURES
6.8 Continuous Learning Points (CLP).
Designated Source Selection trainers may grant CLPs to source selection attendees. As a general rule, CLPs must be given
based on the length and intensity of the training provided. Trainers may grant six (6) CLPs for each full day of instruction,
three (3) CLPs for half-day, and one (1) CLP for a two-hour session.

MP5315.4 CONTRACT PRICING
MP5315.400-1
MP5315.4 Contract Pricing
MP5315.400-1 Proposal Instructions.
To facilitate timely awards of sole source contract actions and definitization of Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCA)
within 180-days after receipt of qualifying proposal, contracting officers:
a. provide contractors with clear and concise proposal instructions, including a suspense date for proposal submission;
b. require that contractor proposals (both prime and subcontractors) are submitted as adequate for evaluation and valid
for the anticipated time required to conduct evaluation, audit, negotiation and award, with data updates provided until the
conclusion of negotiations in accordance with Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act.
c. Include DFARS provision 252.215-7009 in sole-source draft and final Requests for Proposals (DRFPs/RFPs) and RFPs
for UCAs when the contract value is anticipated to exceed the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data, and no
exception to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data applies. (See FAR 15.403-1(b).)
d. Include a provision substantially the same as L-XXX, Cost Proposal Adequacy and Structure, in the solicitation, or as
a paragraph within a letter RFP, whenever DFARS provision 252.215-7009 is included. Add paragraph (e) to provision L-
XXX, Cost Proposal Adequacy and Structure, only when an electronic version of the cost proposal with active formulas (e.g.,
in Excel) is required. Contracting officers may tailor this provision as necessary to reflect the unique circumstances of each
acquisition.
L-XXX COST PROPOSAL ADEQUACY AND STRUCTURE
NOTE  :  The blue italicized text below represents instructions for the contracting officer and should be removed prior to
incorporating Section L into the solicitation.
(a) In response to this Request for Proposals (RFP), the offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data
and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. Further, the offeror shall (1) utilize the DFARS
provision 252.215-7009, Proposal Adequacy Checklist (PAC), in pre-submission proposal quality reviews, and (2) furnish the
completed checklist as part of their proposal submission.
(1) The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with the offeror.
The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the contracting officer has the
information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price.
(2) If the offeror is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately
comply with a checklist item, the offeror shall contact the contracting officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but
in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions.
(3) Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision
will require immediate correction; however, completion of the checklist does not relieve the offeror from the responsibility to
comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation.
(4) The offeror is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or
pricing data in support of this RFP.
(b) The offeror is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost
proposals unreasonable and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating
profit.
(c) In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall
provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any
of the exceptions to certified cost or pricing data found at FAR 15.403-1(b) and DFARS 212.102(a)(i)(B).
(d) Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to
the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP.
(1) Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN
prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the contracting officer’s direction, the breakout by year shall also
be provided by: (select applicable breakouts)
Government Fiscal Year (GFY)
Calendar Year (CY)
The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January – December).
(2) If the proposal includes more than one CLIN/subCLIN, recurring/non-recurring costs shall be identified for each
CLIN/subCLIN.
(3) When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the
total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet or other format approved by the contracting officer).
-1
MP5315.400-1
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
i. When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base
value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated.
ii. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in
quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment.
(4) All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall
identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the
calculation of proposed costs based on CERs.
(5) For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred
as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be
provided in a time-phased cost element summary format.
(6) Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. (Insert in RFPs for follow-on efforts as applicable. The contracting
officer may identify specific contracts for which submission of actual cost data is required (for example, the last three lot
buys of the same item), or may require that the contractor identify its most recent sales of the items to any customers, if the
contractor’s sales base is broader than the current buying office. Language may be tailored to request insight into specific
areas of cost (e.g., sustaining engineering hours). However, the contracting officer should take into consideration the extent
to which the contractor’s existing business systems can support requests for granularity in reporting of actual costs incurred,
as well as the potential time and cost involved in obtaining very detailed or low-level historical actuals.)
(i) The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: [contracting officer identifies the
specific acquisitions for which actual cost data is required. Alternately, the contracting officer may require the contractor to
identify prior and current contracts for the same items covered in this RFP.] For these contracts, the contractor shall provide
the following information:
a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier;
b. contract type;
c. contract quantity;
d. contract price; and
e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on
any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate.
(ii) The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in
the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this
effort. If a subcontractor’s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime’s proposal, the proposal should identify
status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit
the information directly to the contracting officer.
(7) The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier
contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from
proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the contracting officer as soon as the offeror becomes aware
of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve the offeror of the responsibility to accomplish and
provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts.
(8) If the offeror intends to request Performance-Based Payments (PBP), the offeror’s proposal shall include a monthly
expenditure profile, proposed events and their projected completion dates, rationale on why the proposed event demonstrates
significant progress towards the completion of the end item, proposed values for each event, completion criteria for each
event, and an identification of each event as severable or cumulative.
(9) Commercial product and commercial service considerations:
i. The offeror’s proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor commercial product or commercial service
determinations, addressing, at a minimum, the following:
a. A description of the supplies or services;
b. Specific identification of the type of commercial product or commercial service claim (FAR 2.101 commercial product
sub-definitions (1) through (6) or commercial service sub-definitions (1) through (3)), and the basis on which the product or
service meets the definition; and
c. For modified commercial products (commercial product sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with
supporting rationale as either:
1. Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial product sub-definition (3)
(i)); or
-2
MP5315.4 CONTRACT PRICING
MP5315.400-1
2. A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal
Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial product sub-definition (3)(ii)).
Note that per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B), modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not
customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in FAR 2.101, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial product
definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds
the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-4) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time
of contract award.
ii. For proposed subcontract commercial products or commercial services “of a type”, or “evolved” or modified
(FAR 2.101 commercial product sub-definitions (1) through (3) or commercial service sub-definition (2)), the offeror shall
provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed product or service and the comparison product or
service and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed product or service and the comparison product or
service.
iii. The proposal shall include, or the offeror shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data
to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial product or commercial service (to include any
modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying:
a. Information/data related to competition, if competition is the offeror’s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the
proposed subcontract price.
b. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales
data directly to the contracting officer if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary.
c. The prime contractor’s or higher tier subcontractor’s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the
commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2).
d. Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance
with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial products
offered but never actually sold to the public, “of a type” commercial products or commercial services, or when sales data is
limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities.
Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial products and commercial services
is to obtain commercial sales data. It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation
of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained. Sales data shall
(1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities. Products sold to
state, local, or foreign governments or products sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US
Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial product meets the
FAR 2.101 commercial product definition sub-definition (6).
(10) Additional Cost/Price Proposal Requirements: (Identify any additional requirements applicable to the solicitation,
or enter “N/A”.
- If an electronic CBOM providing traceability to the CLIN level, to WBS paragraph, etc. is required, identify that
requirement in this paragraph.
- If sales data supporting price reasonableness of a commercial product or commercial service is required, use this
paragraph to provide specifics as to the level of detail and applicable date range(s) of the sales data.
- If a breakout of basic and options is required, detail that requirement here)
Add the following paragraph to provision L-XXX, Cost Proposal Adequacy and Structure, only when an electronic version
of the cost proposal with active formulas (e.g., in Excel) is required. This paragraph may be tailored as necessary to describe
the specific requirements of the electronic cost model.
(e) Submission of electronic cost model. (Tailor as needed for each specific circumstance. If electronic cost models are
required for any subcontractors or affiliates, identify those requirements within this paragraph.)The proposal submission
shall include an electronic cost model with active formulas demonstrating the mathematical calculation of the proposed cost
(in Excel or other format approved by the contracting officer). The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of
cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as
directed by the contracting officer. If applicable, the electronic cost model shall link each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
to the applicable CLINs. The electronic cost model shall roll up to an annual and total program summary by cost element. All
information supporting each CLIN should be visible and verifiable in the electronic cost model. The formulas included in the
electronic cost model shall not be locked, and the model shall be editable by the Government.
NOTE  :  The blue italicized text above represents instructions for the contracting officer and should be removed prior to
incorporating Section L into the solicitation.

MP5315.400-2.
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
MP5315.400-2. Requesting data/documentation after receipt of the proposal.
a. A contracting officer request for supporting data/documentation from a contractor (whether verbally or in writing) after
proposal receipt, must clearly state what data/documentation is needed and when it should be provided.
b. If requested data/documentation is not readily available because of extenuating circumstances (e.g., data that did
not form the basis of the contractor's proposal), the contracting officer and the contractor should agree in writing as to a
reasonable time for submittal of data.
c. Where system generated data is to be provided, the contracting officer should review the data fields to be reported
before the data is generated to ensure a common understanding of what is needed. Inform the contractor that all data requests
will be tracked and will be considered open action items until the Government concurs that the data has been received and is
complete.
d. If the data is not provided by the requested date or, if applicable, the agreed-to-date, and an acceptable resolution
cannot be achieved, the contracting officer must elevate the issue to appropriate senior contracting management for both the
Government and the contractor until an appropriate resolution is reached. The contracting officer must document the outcome
of the elevation process in writing to include any revised dates for receipt of requested data/documentation. See the DoD Sole
Source Streamlining Tool Box for the recommended elevation process, as well as other streamlining techniques.
e. If, after elevation, an acceptable resolution has not occurred or the contractor fails to provide the data/documentation
within the revised agreed-to date, the contracting officer may take remedial actions:
for UCAs, contracting officers should consider reducing or suspending progress payments (FAR 32.503-6) when the
contractor does not submit a timely qualifying proposal or has otherwise not supported the established definitization
schedule; and/or
assign an unsatisfactory rating for a singular performance problem, such as the failure to submit a timely, complete
and quality proposal (or subsequent data submissions), in connection with a UCA when the problem is of such serious
magnitude that it alone justifies an unsatisfactory Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) rating in
the assessment of Management Responsiveness (Block 18d(1) for a Systems CPAR) or Business Relations (Block 18d for a
Non-Systems CPAR). Ratings must track to the Evaluation Ratings Definitions found in FAR 42.1503(h)(4).
f. Consistent with the notice given to contractors in the provision L-XXX, Cost Proposal Adequacy and Structure, in
situations when the contractor’s original proposal is inadequate and requires revision or rework, contracting officers should
consider whether to recognize as reasonable any contractor costs associated with the revision/rework effort and must consider
the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when negotiating profit.
MP5315.404-1-90 Pricing Assistance or Pricing Assistance Waiver
(b) Requesting Pricing Assistance.
(1) “Full Pricing Assistance” means the price analyst accomplishes the majority of the pricing effort (e.g. pricing case)
for a specific contract action which meets or exceeds the thresholds identified in DAFFARS 5315.404-1-90(a). Submit the
request for pricing assistance in accordance with the local submission process. If no local process exists, submit requests for
pricing assistance to the Pricing Chief (or Chief of the Clearance and Program Support office where there is no designated
Pricing Chief). The contracting officer may also request full pricing assistance for actions below the thresholds identified in
DAFFARS 5315.404-1-90(a) when additional pricing expertise is needed. The Pricing Chief (or Chief of the Clearance and
Program Support office where there is no designated Pricing Chief) is the approval authority for those requests, on a case by
case basis. See the tailorable Request for Pricing Assistance or Pricing Assistance Waivertemplate.
(2) “Tailored Pricing Assistance” may also be requested for actions below the mandatory thresholds (or in conjunction
with a Pricing Assistance Waiver Request) and will be provided at the discretion of the Pricing Chief (or Chief of the
Clearance and Program Support office where there is no designated Pricing Chief). See the tailorable Request for Pricing
Assistance or Pricing Assistance Waiver template. Examples of Tailored Pricing Assistance that may be available include:
(i) Assistance with completion of the Weighted Guidelines (DD Form 1547)
(ii) Pricing inputs for business/contract clearance
(iii) Cost proposal spreadsheet development/modeling
(iv) Defective pricing
(v) Assistance with structuring Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clauses
(vi) Assistance with determination of final prices of incentive contracts
(vii) Claims
(viii) PNM review
(ix) Assistance with/review of reopener clauses

MP5315.407-90
(x) Evaluating Performance Based Payments
(xi) Source selection support, including drafting and/or review of Sections L and M, drafting cost sections of
briefings and reports, and review of pricing volumes of proposals
(xii) Rate and factor reviews when DCMA assistance is not available
(3) Request pricing assistance as early as practicable in the acquisition process, but no later than receipt of the proposal.
For large dollar sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer is expected to consult with the pricing office (or Clearance
and Program Support office) to determine which components of the L-XXX Cost Proposal Adequacy and Structure
provision described in MP5315.4-1.d, should be included in the RFP.
(c) Requesting a Pricing Assistance Waiver. Contracting officers may request a Pricing Assistance Waiver for acquisitions
which meet or exceed the required thresholds identified in DAFFARS 5315.404-1-90(a). Submit the waiver request to the
CAA in accordance with the local submission process. If no local process exists, the waiver should be submitted to the CAA
through the Pricing Chief (or Chief of the Clearance and Program Support office where there is no designated Pricing Chief).
See the tailorable Request for Pricing Assistance or Pricing Assistance Waiver template .
MP5315.407-90 Contract Audit Follow-up (CAFU)
1. This Mandatory Procedure implements the following publications:
a. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-50, Audit Follow-up;
b. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 7650.03, Follow-up on Government Accountability Office (GAO),
Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), and Internal Audit Reports; and
c. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 7640.02, Policy for Follow-up on Contract Audit Reports.
d. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 7650.02, Engaging with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on
GAO Audits.
The publications above establish policy and responsibilities, reporting requirements, and follow-up procedures for contract
audit reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG
DoD), Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and the other internal audit agencies (such as the Air Force Audit Agency
(AFAA)).
2. SAF/AQCP manages the Department of the Air Force (DAF) CAFU program
3.CAFU requirements for DCAA audit reports:
a. SCO RESPONSIBILITIES: SCOs:
(i) Designate a CAFU focal point to manage the organization’s CAFU program in accordance with these procedures.
The CAFU Focal Point:
(a) Monitors and ensures proper and timely resolution and disposition of contract audit reports within the focal
point’s organization.
(b) Maintains current records on all reportable audits, from receipt through disposition. For open reports, this
includes written milestone plans comprised, as a minimum, of target resolution and disposition dates.
(c) Ensures that acquisition personnel within their organization are properly trained in the use of contract audit
reports and the requirements of the CAFU program.
(d) Ensures that the organization’s semi-annual CAFU status report is prepared in accordance with these
procedures using the web-based AT-AT tool on PIEE and User’s manual located on the Defense Contract Management
Agency (DCMA) website. When the security classification of a contract or an audit precludes the use of the DCMA website,
SCOs must seek approval from SAF/AQCP to use alternate means of reporting.
(e) Directs periodic evaluations of the organization’s CAFU program to determine whether they are adequate and
result in timely, appropriate resolution and disposition of audit reports.
b. CONTRACTING OFFICER (CO) RESPONSIBILITIES: The CO is responsible for reaching agreement with
the contractor and has wide latitude and discretion in that regard. Accordingly, the procedure contained herein is structured
in consonance with the independent, decision-making role of the CO and the financial advisory role of the contract auditor.
COs should give full consideration to contract audit advice and must pursue timely and proper resolution and disposition of
contract audit reports. Resolution of contract audit reports, other than pre-award reports, is required by OMB Circular A-50 to
be accomplished within six months of report issuance. Disposition should take place as soon as possible after resolution. Per
DoDI 7640.02, Enclosure 3, Section 3.a, reportable audits should normally be disposed of within 12 months after issuance.
The CO must document the disposition of all reported findings and recommendations in a signed and dated memorandum in
accordance with DoDI 7640.02, Enclosure 3, Section 3.b.

c.  TRACKING OF AUDIT REPORTS: Contracting activities must track all contract audit reports. Tracking of
non-reportable audits may be accomplished using records maintained in the contract file or in the CAFU on-line system.
The designated focal point at each DAF contracting activity maintains contract audit follow-up information on a current
basis. The audit tracking information will normally be managed centrally at MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU headquarters
(except for HQ AFMC, where this tracking will occur at the field activity). For auditor-determined final, indirect cost rate
reports, a report is considered received for follow-up tracking purposes when it is forwarded by the auditor to the cognizant
Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) for resolution and disposition.
d.  REPORTING OF AUDIT REPORTS: Reportable audits are identified in the Glossary of DoDI 7640.02. The
information to be reported on each audit is identified in Enclosure 4 of the same regulation. MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU
semi-annual status reports will be automatically transmitted using the on-line CAFU system. The reports must cover the
semi-annual periods ending 31 Mar and 30 Sep and must be completed in the on-line CAFU system no later than the end
of the reporting period. If there are no audits, a negative report must be prepared and submitted to the SAF/AQC Workflow
with a copy to the cognizant HCA Workflow. All activities must make every possible effort to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of their semi-annual reporting submission. Special attention should be focused on ensuring the most accurate data is
submitted on any audit listed as unresolved and over 6 months old.
4. CAFU for GAO, IG DoD, and Internal Audit Reports: These procedures apply to audit reports which disclose contract
pricing issues and are issued directly to the buying activity. COs shall provide:
a. An initial response to the GAO/IG DoD/Internal Audit Agency within 60 days of receipt of the audit report; and
b. A copy of the initial response and the disposition documents to the following:
(i) SAF/FMPF, 1130 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1130.
(ii) SAF/AQCP, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, 4C169, Washington, DC 20330-1060.
(iii) Cognizant HCA Workflow.
(iii) Office of the Inspector General, Department of Defense, Attn: DAIG, GAO Report Analysis, 4800 Mark Center

MP5315.6 — UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS
MP5315.606-90 Receipt, Evaluation, and Disposition of Unsolicited Proposals
(a) Unsolicited proposals (UP) are defined at FAR 2.101 and described in FAR 15.603(c). MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs/DRUs/
DAFRCO and subordinate contracting units are considered to be the cognizant points of contact for ensuring evaluation and
disposition of a UP which is received at their respective base/activity. Organizations that are part of the Headquarters Air
Force (HAF) that receive a submission that is considered a UP must forward it to SAF/AQC for assignment to the proper
Department of the Air Force (DAF) MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU/DAFRCO contracting unit cognizant point of contact.
(b) Cognizant points of contact:
(1) Coordinate and process UPs. Use a cover sheet to help protect the UP from unauthorized disclosure.
(2) Notify the SCO for any UP that requires wider DAF consideration.
(3) Maintain an accurate and complete record of the disposition of all UPs received.
(4) Ensure the appropriate evaluation office is aware of the FAR guidance for evaluating UPs and the prohibitions and
rules regarding copying, disclosing, and using restricted data contained in the proposal. Limit the distribution of UPs to the
appropriate number of evaluators required to conduct a reasonable review. Maintain a record of the evaluators for each UP
and the dates of their evaluation.
(5) Ensure evaluators provide supporting rationale for their conclusions and recommendations. If the recommendation
is to accept the UP, ensure evaluators indicate whether funds are currently available or programmed.
(6) Notify the offeror concerning results of the evaluation within 30 working days from receipt of the UP. When the
evaluation cannot be completed within 30 working days, send the offeror an interim reply to include an estimated completion
date.
(7) Advise the offeror that the favorable evaluation does not, in itself, contractually bind the government.

Follow these mandatory procedures when requesting approval to purchase restricted items under DFARS 225.7002; for
example, food, clothing, tents, tarpaulins, covers, cotton, and hand or measuring tools. The requirement to comply with
these statutory and regulatory restrictions applies to procurements in excess of $150,000. This MP provides assistance in

make every effort to do so. See DFARS 225.7002 for the entire list.
MP5325.7002-2-2. DNAD Exception
a.    Individual DNADs
When a contractor asserts that a domestic item identified at DFARS 225.7002-1 cannot be acquired as and when needed in
a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity at U.S. market prices, a DNAD is required. The SecAF may approve the DNAD
if compliant items, identified at DFARS 225.7002-1, of satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity, and in the required form,
cannot be procured at U.S. market prices as and when needed. This approval authority is not delegable. This exception should
not be read to require that the compliant material/item must be totally unavailable (i.e., cannot be obtained at any cost). There
is some cost limit that should be recognizable by a contracting officer, and that a reasonable person would agree, makes the
material/item effectively “unavailable.”
b.  Class DNADs
Contracting officers may continue to use OUSD (A&S)-approved class DNADs that cover food, clothing, fabrics, and
hand or measuring tools for new contracts if the DNAD was signed by the Undersecretary of Defense (OUSD) (A&S)
bya Service Secretary, or by the Director of Defense Logistics Agency. The OUSD (A&S) DNADs currently available
for reciprocal use are posted on the DCMA website. If a class DNAD is used, the contracting officer must prepare a
Determination and Finding (D&F) approved by the SCO. This approval may not be further delegated. The contracting officer
must obtain legal review to support the determination.

Advance payment requests must be processed as follows:
(1) The contracting officer must compile the advance payment request package in accordance with FAR 32.4 and
DFARS 232.4 and submit it to the SCO for coordination. The SCO must submit the request through the cognizant HCA
Workflow. The cognizant HCA forwards the package to SAF/FMF for review and approval. DAFRCO and SpRCO will
submit the request directly to the cognizant HCA, as appropriate.
(2) SAF/FMF will evaluate the request to determine if advance payments are justified. Assistance may be solicited
from other sources such as contracting officers, auditors, disbursing officers, and, if necessary, field visits to the contractor
or institution. When approved, SAF/FMF will forward the findings, determinations, and authorization for advance payments
to the responsible contracting officer. The contracting officer must ensure all applicable advance payment clauses are
incorporated into each contract.
MP5332.470 Advance Payment Pool
(1) Advanced Payment Pool requests should follow the same instructions as outlined in MP5332.402 above. In
addition, for nonprofit educational or research institutions, SAF/FMF will determine if approved advance payments will be
disbursed from an advance payment pool in accordance with DFARS 232.470. When approved, SAF/FMF will forward the
findings, determinations, and authorization for the advance payment pool agreement to the responsible contracting officer.
The contracting officer must ensure all applicable advance payment clauses are incorporated into each contract. The clause at
DFARS 252.232-7000, Advance Payment Pool, must be incorporated into each contract that is covered by the agreement.

reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this
solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.”
(b) When the resulting contract is to be funded by Procurement or Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
appropriations, the program/requirement must be included in the President’s budget as submitted to Congress, and the
program manager must provide the contracting officer a written statement, indicating the program's inclusion. The statement
must be coordinated with FM at the Center level (or equivalent) or as delegated to FM Organizational Senior Functional
(OSF) that these investment funds will be used for the proposed acquisition and, although not presently available, a
reasonable expectation exists that funding will be authorized and available upon enactment of the Authorization and
Appropriations Acts.
(c) For solicitations for programs funded by the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account when the Defense
Appropriations Act is signed into law, for the Air National Guard Bureau, and/or Air Force Reserve Command, the Air
National Guard or Reserve program manager must confirm that funds have been identified for the acquisition.
(d) Except for solicitations for operational contracting supply requirements less than $1M and funded with annual
appropriations, the MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU/DAFRCO Requiring Activity Functional Commander/Director, SCO, and

MP5333.104 Protests to GAO
Revised: June 2024
(a) General
(1) The Department of the Air Force response to a GAO bid protest must comply with GAO’s Bid Protest Regulations
(4 CFR Part 21) and FAR) 33.104 as supplemented. For guidance on responding to unclassified protests, follow the Air
Force Commercial Litigation Field Support Center Protest Guide. For guidance on responding to classified protests,
follow the Administrative Guide for Processing Classified GAO Protests. Both documents are also available from
AF.JAQC.AFLOA.Workflow.Org@us.af.mil.
(2) SAF/AQC serves as the notification point with the GAO for all protests.
Phone: (571) 256-7077, DSN 260-7077
E-mail: SAF.AQ.SAF-AQC.Workflow@us.af.mil
(3) The Air Force Commercial Litigation Field Support Center (AF/JACQ) represents the Air Force on all protests.
Phone: (240) 612-6661, DSN 612-6661
E-mail: AF.JAQC.AFLOA.Workflow.Org@us.af.mil
(4) The contracting officer must send any communication to the GAO through AF/JACQ with a courtesy copy to SAF/
AQC and to the SCO focal point. Forward any inquiry received from an attorney representing a protestor or interested party
to AF/JACQ.
(5) The focal point is designated by the SCO who receives communication from SAF/AQC or AF/JACQ concerning
protests against Department of the Air Force solicitations or awards.
(6) The supporting legal office is the office that provides legal support to the contracting activity that received the
protest. An attorney from the supporting legal office will draft the memorandum of law, and otherwise support the defense of
the protest. AF/JAQ will provide protest guidance to the supporting legal office.
(b) Actions upon Receipt of Protest
(1) SAF/AQC will notify the contracting activity when a protest has been filed with the GAO. The contracting activity
must immediately notify its supporting legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice.
(2) The contracting officer must, within one business day of receiving the protest:
(i) Forward a copy of the protest to its supporting legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice.
(ii) Provide a copy of the protest (or a redacted copy if the protest is designated as containing protected material) to
the awardee, or if no award has been made, to all offerors who appear to have a reasonable prospect of receiving award. If no
redacted copy of a protected protest was received, so advise AF/JACQ who will raise the issue with the protester.
(iii) Advise AF/JACQ, SAF/AQC, and the cognizant HCA Workflow (if HCA is other than DAS(C) or ADAS(C))
as to all actions being taken regarding a stay of performance and any override of the stay to include:
(A) A discussion of whether a stay of performance or award is required IAW 31 U.S.C. 3553.
(B) If a stay is required IAW FAR 33.104(b) or (c), whether an override will be sought to lift the stay. (See
paragraph (f).)
(C) If a stay is not required, discuss whether a suspension of performance or termination of the contract is in the
best interest of the Department of the Air Force.
(iv) Send an email to AF/JACQ with the name, phone number, and e-mail address of the contracting officer and the
local attorney.
(3) The contracting officer is responsible for generating the contracting officer’s statement of facts. Within ten
days after the Department of the Air Force receives the protest, provide the draft statement of facts and table of contents to its
supporting legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice.
(4) The supporting legal office/local attorney is responsible for preparing the initial memorandum of law, which
will include a legal analysis of each ground of protest.
(5) The contracting officer must e-mail drafts of the initial memorandum of law, statement of facts, and table of
contents (including a listing of any requested documents deemed irrelevant) to AF/JACQ (copying the focal point) as soon as
practicable, but not later than 15 days after the Department of the Air Force is notified of the protest (or seven days from the
date the express option is invoked by the GAO).
(c) Hearings
(i) If GAO calls for a hearing, the contracting activity must provide the requested witnesses and other support
required by AF/JACQ. The contracting activity is responsible for funding witness travel and TDY costs.

Revised June 12, 2024
MP5333.104
DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
(ii) At the request of the GAO through AF/JACQ or at the request of AF/JACQ, the contracting activity must obtain
and fund court reporter services to transcribe the hearing. The cost of court reporter services is typically shared between the
contracting activity, the protester, and the intervener.
(d) Resolving the Protest
(1) GAO Decision. If the protest goes to a written decision, the GAO will issue the decision within 100 days of the
filing of the original protest. A protest decision involving protected information will be released to the parties under the
protective order. A protected decision may be viewed within the government, but may not be released to, or discussed with,
non-government personnel unless those personnel have been explicitly admitted to access of protected material under the
protective order. Generally, those admitted to access under the protective order will be legal counsel for the protester and
interveners. The GAO will issue a public redacted version of the decision at a later date.
(i) Denial or Dismissal. If the GAO denies or dismisses a protest, the protest is closed. The Air Force can proceed
with all contractual actions upon notification of denial or dismissal.
(ii) Sustain. If the GAO sustains a protest, the GAO will also recommend corrective action and may recommend
payment of reasonable protest costs, to include reasonable attorney fees. In some cases the GAO may also recommend
payment of proposal preparation costs.
(A) Corrective action should be accomplished pursuant to paragraph (e) below. A decision not to comply with a
GAO recommendation for corrective action may only be made by the cognizant HCA. Any recommendation not to comply
with GAO’s corrective action recommendation must be coordinated with the focal point and forwarded through the SCO to
the cognizant HCA Workflow and AF/JACQ within 15 days of the date of the decision.
(B) Potential costs may include attorney fees and in-house costs related to pursuit of the protest. Costs must be
paid by the base or procuring activity.
(2) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Resolution of the protest may be possible through use of ADR. Outcome
prediction is a form of ADR commonly used in bid protests in which the GAO advises the parties of its likely position if
the protest were resolved in a written decision. Department of the Air Force policy is to follow the outcome prediction
recommendations. Other nonbinding ADR procedures (including but not limited to mediation) are available and should be
considered for use in appropriate cases. When considering the use of ADR proceedings other than outcome prediction to
resolve a bid protest, and before initiating an ADR proceeding, the contracting officer and AF/JACQ must notify SAF/GCR
and SAF/GCQ and work with those offices to identify an ADR procedure appropriate to the individual case.
(3) Withdrawal. The protester may withdraw the protest, either because of corrective action taken by the Department
of the Air Force or for other reasons. Once the protester gives notice of withdrawal to the GAO and the GAO closes its file,
the contracting activity can resume all contractual actions.
(e) Corrective Action
(1) Corrective action may be taken by the Department of the Air Force at any time during the protest process or upon
the recommendation of the GAO when a protest is sustained. Within five days of a decision to take corrective action (either
voluntary or as recommended by the GAO), the contracting officer must provide a corrective action plan through their SCO
to the cognizant HCA Workflow and AF/JACQ. The contracting officer must notify the cognizant HCA and AF/JACQ if
there are any significant changes to the corrective action plan, if the corrective action will not be completed within 60 days,
and when the corrective action is complete. The focal point should be copied on these messages.
(f) Mandatory Stay of Award or Performance
(1) Statutory Requirements (31 USC 3551-3556)
(i) FAR 33.104(c)(1), in conjunction with Class Deviation 2018-O0011, Enhanced Postaward Debriefing Rights,
state that if the protest is received within the following deadlines, the agency has to withhold award or, if award has been
made, immediately issue a stop work order to the awardee:
Ten days after date of contract award;
If a debriefing is required, five days after the debriefing date offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request and
no additional questions related to the debriefing are submitted; or
Five days after the government delivers its written response to additional questions submitted by the unsuccessful offeror.
(ii) The Department of the Air Force can override a stay in appropriate circumstances when it can show a requisite
level of harm resulting from a delay of contract award or performance. A challenge to the override decision is brought before
the Court of Federal Claims vice GAO.
(2) Overriding Stay of Award (protest filed before award).
(i) See DAFFARS 5333.104(b)(1) for processing instructions.

Revised June 12, 2024
MP5333.1 - PROTESTS
MP5333.104
(ii) A stay of award may only be overridden by “urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect
interests of the United States.” These circumstances may include delays, work stoppages, or performance degradations that
severely impact mission-critical operations.
(iii) All requests must include facts that establish the urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect
the interests of the United States. The request must explain, if there is an incumbent, why the incumbent’s contract cannot be
extended. The request must explain what other options are available and why those options, if any, are not viable.
(3) Overriding Stay of Performance (protest filed after award).
(i) See 5333.104(c)(2) for processing instructions.
(ii) A stay of performance may only be overridden by urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect
interests of the United States, or where performance of the contract is in the best interests of the United States.
(iii) HCA Override. See Override D&F Template. NOTE: The template contains guidance on the last few pages of
the document.
(A) The request to the cognizant HCA for an override must include the findings required by FAR33.104(b) or (c).
(B) The cognizant HCA will make a decision with respect to authorizing award or continued performance within
ten days of the protest notification by SAF/AQC. If circumstances change after suspension of contract performance, the
contracting officer may initiate a request to continue performance.
(C) The cognizant HCA’s decision to override is not effective until a written finding is made and the agency
files with GAO either a copy of any issued determination and finding, or a statement by the individual who approved the

MP5342.902 Bankruptcy Procedures
Revised: June 2024
(a) When an office (typically contracting, financial management, or legal) first learns of bankruptcy proceedings that may
involve or affect the Department of the Air Force, that office must as a minimum provide notice to its supporting contracting,
financial management, and legal offices. Once the contracting office and legal office are notified, they must work as a team to
carry out the following responsibilities:
(1) The contracting office must furnish notice of the bankruptcy to any affected buying activities and to the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service Office of General Counsel (DFAS-HGB) at the following address:
Office of General Counsel
DFAS-HGB
Defense Finance and Accounting Service
8899 E. 56th Street
Indianapolis, IN 46249-0160
The legal office must furnish notice to the Bankruptcy Branch of the Commercial Litigation Division of the Air Force
Legal Services Agency (AFLOA/JAQ) at the following address:
AFLOA/JAQ
1500 West Perimeter Road, Suite 4100
Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762
Provide notice irrespective of whether any contracts have been closed, terminated, or still have performance outstanding.
Make notifications via the most expeditious method, but no later than three days after learning of the bankruptcy. Notify
promptly, whether or not all required information is initially available, and even in cases where it appears the notifying office,
itself, received late notice. Ensure the notification includes:
(A) The name of the debtor/contractor, including all known affiliates who have filed for bankruptcy;
(B) The court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed;
(C) The date the bankruptcy petition was filed; and
(D) The case number assigned by the bankruptcy court.
(2) Make an assessment of each of the debtor’s contracts and determine:
(A) If the Department of the Air Force has a claim or potential claim against the debtor/contractor (e.g., based on
unliquidated progress payments, nonconforming goods, estimated excess reprocurement costs, etc.), whether the contract is
ongoing, closed, terminated, or otherwise in litigation.
(B) The current status and performance experience of each ongoing contract. The contractor may request the
court’s permission to assume, sell, reject, or continue performing ongoing contracts. The contracting officer will need to
coordinate with AF/JACQ to determine how best to pursue the most favorable course.
(C) If the debtor/contractor is in possession of any Government furnished equipment, Government furnished
property, or work in progress for which title has passed to the Government.
(3) The contracting officer and legal office must promptly advise AF/JACQ regarding all Government property in the
possession of, or under the control of, the debtor/contractor. Failure to address such property in a timely manner may result
in a loss to the Government if the property is lost, sold, or otherwise improperly disposed of by the debtor/contractor or the
court appointed trustee. The contracting officer must suspend payments to the contractor/debtor while making the assessment
of each contract. (The contracting officer must contact the appropriate DFAS payment office if necessary to halt a previous or
recurring payment request.)
(A) On those contracts where the Department of the Air Force has no claim or potential claim against the
contractor, the contracting officer may resume payments to the contractor only for amounts due post-petition. The “petition
date” is the date the bankruptcy was filed with the court. Post-petition payments are only for debts based on work performed,
or goods delivered, after the debtor/contractor filed for bankruptcy. If an invoice does not clearly indicate whether it is
based upon pre-petition or post-petition performance, the contracting officer should contact the debtor’s/contractor’s billing
office—prior to making any payments—to request invoicing that clearly identifies whether the requested payment is for
pre-petition or post-petition work. It is the debtor’s/contractor’s responsibility to bifurcate invoices into pre-petition and
post-petition billing where a particular job spans the bankruptcy filing date. The supporting attorney will need to assist
the contracting officer in obtaining appropriate invoices if the billing is being conducted by the trustee or the debtor’s/
contractor’s bankruptcy counsel. NOTE: contracting officers must work closely with DFAS to ensure post-petition payments

DOD FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENT
reference only those post-petition invoices approved and forwarded by the contracting officer for payment. Be aware that
DFAS’ normal business practice may be to pay the oldest invoice on file first. Inadvertent payment of pre-petition invoices,
versus the intended post-petition invoices, may result in the Government’s loss of security and, ultimately, reduce the
potential for recovery of Government claims.
(B) The contracting officer should continue to withhold amounts due for pre-petition performance or deliveries
while AFLOA/JAQ works with DFAS and the Department of Justice to determine if there are other Government claims
which should be offset against those pre-petition amounts owed. Pre-petition debts are those amounts due for work performed
or goods delivered before the bankruptcy petition was filed with the court. The contracting officer must not authorize pre-
petition payments without prior coordination with and approval from AF/JACQ.
(C) These payment provisions augment, rather than supersede, otherwise applicable requirements regarding
certification of payment requests.
(4) The contracting office and legal office must furnish information as follows:
(A) Any information required above, but not available at the time of initial reporting, must be provided to the
respective office(s). Information reporting and coordination is a continuing requirement for both the contracting and legal
offices.
(B) Not later than 15 days after receiving notice of a bankruptcy filing, the contracting officer must submit a
report to DFAS-HGB and AF/JACQ detailing:
(i) Each contract (by debtor’s/contractor’s or affiliate’s name) and the nature thereof;
(ii) All potential Government claims against the debtor/contractor (by contract), including the basis for each claim
and the method used to determine the amount due (even when the amount is an estimate);
(iii) The status of each contract, including the percentage completed, the performance experience to date (including
post-petition), and actions taken regarding the withholding or resumption of payments; and
(iv) Any available information regarding the debtor’s/contractor’s intent regarding the future of each contract and
the contracting officers’ thoughts regarding the same.
(C) All correspondence relative to the bankruptcy received from any source must be copied and forwarded to AF/
JACQ within one business day of receipt.
(D) Any claims or requests for equitable adjustment from the debtor/contractor or trustee must be copied and
forwarded to AF/JACQ.
(b) The contracting officer and supporting attorney must consult AF/JACQ prior to taking any of the following actions
regarding the debtor/contractor:
(1) Issuing a show cause letter or cure notice;
(2) Terminating a contract, either for default or the convenience of the Government, or canceling a contract or an order
under a contract;
(3) Setting off or recouping debts, or otherwise attempting to collect or recover amounts owed by the debtor/contractor;
(4) Demanding or otherwise seeking to recover Government property;
(5) Initiating reprocurement of the goods or services provided under a contract;
(6) Issuing a new contract to or exercising an option to extend a contract with the debtor/contractor; or
(7) Beginning or continuing any judicial or administrative action or proceeding against the debtor/contractor that could
have been brought before the bankruptcy petition was filed.

(a) Contracting officers must refer to Volume 2A, Chapter 1, paragraph 2.14.3.2.1 of DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial
Management Regulation, for Congressional notification and additional approval requirements for Special Termination Cost
Clauses (STCC). Because STCCs require special notification to Congress and entail a long approval process over which the
Department of the Air Force has little control, the contracting officer should allow Headquarters Air Force Staff sufficient
time to process requests to use DFARS 252.249-7000, Special Termination Costs (i.e., not less than 90 days prior to contract
award). The request must include the following:
(i) A detailed breakdown of applicable cost categories in the clause at DFARS 252.249-7000, (a)(1) through (5),
which includes the reasons for the anticipated incurrence of the costs in each category;
(ii) Information on the financial and program need for the clause including an assessment of the contractor's
financial position and the impact of a failure to receive authority to use the clause; and
(iii) Clear evidence that only costs that arise directly from a termination would be compensated under the clause.
Costs that would be incurred by the Government, regardless of whether a termination occurs, must not be covered by a
STCC.
