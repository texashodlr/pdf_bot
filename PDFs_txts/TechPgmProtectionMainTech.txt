Allocation Systems [DPAS]).  The Program Manager can recommend, via Title I of the 
Defense Production Act, a program for a rated order or Special Priorities Assistance under 
the DPAS Regulation (15 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 700).  Rated orders are a 
strategic tool that may compete with other DAF or DoD deliveries, not just commercial 
orders, and must be considered holistically against other rated orders.  The Program 
Manager’s recommendation is routed to SAF/AQX’s Industrial Liaison Branch which 
coordinates with Air Force Materiel Command’s DPAS office. 
                        1. (Added)(DAF) BIS-999, Request for Special Priorities Assistance, is 
completed by the program manager.  Special Priorities Assistance can be used to expedite 
product (i.e., component level) delivery to meet a special date or to accelerate delivery 
under a rated order due to a change in military urgency.  It can also be used to resolve 
delivery conflicts among various priority rated orders. 
                        2. (Added)(DAF) DD Form 691, Application for Priority Rating for Production 
or Construction Equipment, is completed by the Program Manager.  Defense orders (i.e., 
acquisition program level) are assigned an industrial priority rating of either “DO” (i.e., 
priority) or “DX” (i.e., highest priority).  The “DX” rating is authorized by the Secretary of 
Defense for program of the highest national urgency.  The priority rating cascades from 
the prime contractor down through all subcontractors.  A rated order placed with a 
supplier takes precedence over all non-rated orders and must be filled ahead of the non-
rated orders as needed to meet required delivery dates to resolve DPAS violations, 
interagency or joint conflicts, and routing for BIS-999.  (T-1)

Poorly configured, inadequately maintained, undocumented, or unprotected network and 
system interfaces can be used by threat actors to:  
(a)  Gain unauthorized system access; or 
(b)  Deliver cyber-attacks in the form of malicious software or content. 
 (7)  Fielded Systems. 
The supply chain can expose system functionality to unauthorized access that threat 
actors can potentially exploit to gain access to system functionality.  Battlefield loss and exports 
can expose U.S.-advanced technology to loss from reverse engineering. 
            (a) (Added)(DAF) Utilization of foreign owned and operated depot facilities and 
transportation outside the Continental United States present an increased national security 
challenge and risk to U.S. advanced technology and combat systems due to the overt

3.3.  ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE ADVERSARY THREATS TO TECHNOLOGY AND 
PROGRAMS. 
S&T managers and engineering teams will employ and tailor S&T and program protection 
measures.  S&T managers and engineering teams will assess technology and program risks and 
opportunities to determine necessary protections.  Protection measures include operations 
security, information safeguarding, research protection, designed-in system protections, SCRM, 
software assurance, hardware assurance, anti-counterfeit practices, AT, and program security 
related and engineering cyber-resilient activities.  S&T managers and lead systems engineers will 
be responsible for the procedures as assigned in this paragraph. 
(Added)(DAF) Acquisition Security is a key element of program protection for the 
planning and integration of all security disciplines and other defensive methods into the 
acquisition process.  This protects weapon systems and related sensitive technology, 
technical data to include research data with military applications, and support systems 
from foreign intelligence collection, unauthorized disclosure, sabotage, theft, damage 
throughout the system’s life cycle. 
(Added)(DAF) The use of automation continues to improve product development costs and 
reduce sustainment costs.  These efforts are dependent on software to support automation.  
Software vulnerabilities make up the majority of all system vulnerabilities, thereby 
increasing the need to test using DevSecOps throughout the program lifecycle.
