This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1/20-1, Integrated Life Cycle 
Management, for the acquisition and management of contracted services within the Department of 
the Air Force (DAF). It provides guidance and procedures to meet requirements and processes of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), Department of 
the Air Force FAR Supplement (DAFFARS) and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 
5000.74, Defense Acquisition of Services. This publication applies to civilian employees and 
uniformed members of the United States Space Force, the Regular Air Force, and the Air Force 
Reserve. It applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) when acquiring services through a DAF 
Contracting Office. Applicability and exceptions to this DAFI are detailed in paragraph 1.2. It 
applies to all activities who acquire services through a DAF Contracting Office or utilize funding 
appropriated to the DAF to acquire services. This DAFI may be supplemented at any level, but all 
supplements must be routed to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) of this publication for 
coordination prior to certification and approval and may not restrict the acquisition flexibilities 
contained within. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR 
using the DAF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 
from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure all records generated 
because of processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force Instruction 33-322, Records 
Management and Information Governance Program, and are disposed in accordance with the Air 
Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is located in the Air Force Records Information 
Management System. Any records generated from instructions of this DAFI may become a part of 
the official contract file that has an established disposition schedule and is defined in FAR Part 4, 
Administrative and Information Matters. The authorities to waive Wing/Delta/Unit level 
2 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier number (T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3) following 
the compliance statement. Refer to DAF Manual (DAFMAN) 90-161, Publishing Processes and 
Procedures, Table A10.1, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. 
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval 
authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. See paragraph 
1.3.1 within this publication for further non-tiered waiver guidance. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been revised and should be completely reviewed. Changes include updating 
and clarifying implementation of DoDI 5000.74 resulting from changes to that DoD Instruction, 
addressing organizational changes resulting from the creation of the United States Space Force 
(USSF), changes to roles and responsibilities, and changes to reflect two DAF Service Acquisition 
Executives (SAEs). Removed the term Headquarters Air Force (HAF). HAF now represents the 
Headquarters of the Department of the Air Force which includes the Office of the Secretary of the 
Air Force (known as the Secretariat), Air Staff, and the Office of the Chief of Space Operations 
(known as the Space Staff). For clarity, the instruction uses the terms Secretariat, Air Staff, and 
Space Staff to describe the three specific components within the HAF. Instructions for post-award 
program management have been strengthened. Names and acronyms for two positions have been 
changed to align with their roles and responsibilities more clearly; Services Designated Official 
(SDO) is now Services Acquisition Decision Authority (SADA) and Functional Services Manager 
(FSM) is now Services Acquisition Lead (SAL) (see paragraph 2.11.). A table has been added to 
establish Program Manager (PM)/SAL certification/credentials by Services Category level (see 
Table 2.3.). In Chapter 2, the SAEs specifically appoint the Air Force Program Executive Officer 
for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM) as the Senior Services Manager (SSM). The titles 
of Chapters 3 and 4 have been changed to reflect the full content and restructuring of those 
chapters. Chapter 3 encompasses all information related to the requirements approval process. 
Chapter 4 is structured to correlate with the Seven Steps to the Services Acquisition Process. 
Chapter 5 clarifies policies for the organizational structures by creating separate governance 
instructions for each structure. Chapter 6 updates policy on sharing of the Quality Assurance 
Surveillance Plan with contractors and replaces references to the Contracting Officer 
Representative Tracking (CORT) Tool with information on Procurement Integrated Enterprise 
Environment (PIEE) with associated applications Joint Appointment Module (JAM) and 
Surveillance and Performance Monitoring Module (SPM). Throughout the document, 
requirements established in previous versions of this instruction have been clarified to increase 
adherence.

Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW AND APPLICABILITY 
1.1.  Purpose. 
1.1.1.  The purpose of this DAFI is to ensure DAF services acquisition programs are managed 
effectively, efficiently, and timely to meet mission needs. This instruction seeks to encourage 
synergy within the services acquisition community, which consists of Program 
Managers/Services Acquisition Leads, contracting professionals, functional representatives, 
contracting officer representatives, quality assurance program coordinators, financial 
managers, small business professionals, requiring activity personnel, contract attorneys, and 
any other stakeholder charged with any part of developing, executing, or monitoring a services 
requirement from identification to contract close-out. A services acquisition program (hereafter 
referred to as “program”) is a set of services requirements executed through one or more 
contract actions, interagency agreements, and/or other types of acquisitions with a common 
mission or objective. 
1.1.2.  Organizational entities employ requirements approval and acquisition approval 
authorities based on their assigned delegations. Sections and tables within Chapters 2 and 3 
are divided into these organizational structures to illustrate the instructions specific to each 
entity. The organizational structures are the Secretariat, Air Staff, Office of the Chief of Space 
Operations (Space Staff), Systems Program Executive Officer/Technology Executive Officer 
(S-PEO/TEO), Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Command (FLDCOM), Field Operating 
Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU). 
1.1.3.  Use this instruction in conjunction with DoDI 5000.74, Defense Acquisition of Services, 
and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, to ensure 
successful acquisition of services. 
1.1.4.  The DAF implements the requirements of DoDI 5000.74 for a Services Requirements 
Review Board (SRRB) process in an ongoing, comprehensive, and multi-faceted approach. 
The DAF’s requirements approval process (see Chapter 3) addresses the SRRB elements of 
mission need, strategic alignment, workforce analysis, relationship to other requirements, 
projected cost of requirement, and contract and work functions (i.e., inherently governmental 
functions). The DAF’s services acquisition process (see Chapter 4) employs both the Early 
Strategy and Issues Session (ESIS) and the Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) to address the 
SRRB elements of issues, risk, and prioritization. Additionally, the DAF’s governance 
assessment process (see Chapter 5) provides a comprehensive annual review of both the 
performance of individual programs and the effectiveness of organizations’ management and 
oversight of services acquisitions. Finally, the DAF’s Quality Assurance oversight process (see 
Chapter 6) addresses the SRRB element of metrics. 
1.2.  Applicability. 
1.2.1.  This instruction applies to all personal and non-personal services acquisitions executed 
with DAF appropriations, with a total services acquisition program value, in current year 
dollars, greater than or equal to the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) as defined at FAR 
2.101, Definitions, regardless of the contracting activity, except as exempted in paragraph 
1.2.3.

thresholds. (See para 1.1.1 for the description of a services acquisition program) 
1.2.2.  Programs funded by non-DAF entities that are executed by a DAF organization shall 
comply with this instruction. 
1.2.3.  The following categories of services are exempt from adherence to this DAFI (unless 
designated as a special interest). This DAFI does apply to Advisory and Assistance Services 
(A&AS) contracts that support the otherwise exempt categories set forth in paragraphs 1.2.3.1

Chapter 2 
ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND AUTHORITIES 
2.1.  Overview.  The roles and responsibilities as described in this chapter may include further 
delegations as defined within this DAFI or a Services Management Agreement (SMA). The SMA 
documents specific roles and responsibilities of Secretariat, Air Staff, Space Staff, MAJCOM, 
FLDCOM, FOA, and DRU organizations. 
2.2.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE).  The SAEs are the senior officials responsible for the 
management of acquisition of contract services. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for 
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (SAF/AQ) serves as the SAE of the DAF for non-space 
systems, programs, and related activities. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space 
Acquisition and Integration (SAF/SQ) serves as the SAE of the DAF for space systems, programs, 
and related activities. The SAE is the Services Acquisition Decision Authority (SADA) with the 
authority to assign responsibilities. Each SAE has delegated SADA authorities to AFPEO/CM 
(except for programs assigned to S-PEOs/TEOs), who can further delegate those authorities. Each 
SAE: 
2.2.1.  Assigns responsibility for the review and approval of procurements in each Services 
Category (S-CAT). As SADA, the SAE holds acquisition planning and sourcing decision 
authority for all services acquisitions greater than or equal to the SAT. The S-CATs are based 
on dollar thresholds and establish the level of review, decision authority, and applicable 
procedures in such categories. 
2.2.2.  Establishes policies, procedures, and guidelines. 
2.2.3.  Chairs annual Services Requirements Review (SRR) briefings presented by the S-
PEOs/TEOs under their authority. 
2.3.  DAF Senior Services Manager (SSM).  Each SAE appoints AFPEO/CM as the DAF SSM. 
The SSM is the acquisition expert responsible for assisting with planning, strategic sourcing, 
execution, and management of services acquisitions. The SSM establishes, as appropriate, 
management structures, acquisition governance, and processes to ensure effective implementation 
of policies for the DAF on all services acquisitions. The SSM: 
2.3.1.  Serves as principal advisor to the SAEs for services acquisitions. 
2.3.2.  Informs, guides, and provides advice to the Secretariat, Air Staff, Space Staff, S-
PEOs/TEOs, MAJCOMs, FLDCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs to support their role regarding 
management and oversight for services requirements within their respective portfolios. 
2.3.3.  Provides and maintains policies, procedures, and governance structure for the 
management and oversight of services acquisitions; creates, updates, and maintains templates, 
tools, and guides for use by authorities responsible for services acquisitions. 
2.3.4.  Prepares required Congressional and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) reports.  
Assists S-PEOs/TEOs (as requested) in addressing Congress on services acquisition elements 
within their respective portfolios. 
2.3.5.  Performs enterprise-level data analysis on DAF services acquisitions. 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
9 
2.3.6.  Manages and oversees the requirements approval process for services acquisitions, as 
described in Chapter 3. 
2.3.7.  Facilitates training and development of the services acquisition workforce. 
2.3.8.  Acts as the DAF acquisition liaison to the non-traditional acquisition workforce 
involved in services acquisitions and provides guidance appropriate for their training in 
services acquisition procedures. Non-traditional acquisition workforce personnel are those 
involved in an acquisition but do not occupy an acquisition-coded position or belong to an 
acquisition related career field. 
2.3.9.  Fosters a services acquisition culture within the DAF using focused strategic messaging 
through the conduct of periodic services acquisition seminars, as funding allows. 
2.4.  AF Program Executive Officer for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM).  The 
SAEs for the DAF assign SADA responsibility to AFPEO/CM for the management and execution 
of services requirements not assigned to S-PEOs/TEOs. AFPEO/CM: 
2.4.1.  Executes SADA authority for services acquisitions as assigned by the SAE. Delegates 
SADA authority to designated Secretariat, Air Staff, Space Staff, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, FOA, 
and DRU senior leaders through this DAFI and as further detailed to the specific organization 
through mutually agreed SMAs. 
2.4.2.  Establishes SMAs as necessary. The SMA is a written agreement between the 
AFPEO/CM and the Commander or Director of the MAJCOM, FLDCOM, FOA, or DRU 
organizations. SMAs for the Air Staff and the Space Staff are between the AFPEO/CM and 
the respective Vice Chiefs. Secretariat organizations are included in the Air Staff SMA. The 
SMA establishes the organization’s delegated authorities in keeping with their degree of 
services acquisition maturity, continuous process improvement, workforce qualifications and 
experience to manage services acquisitions, and in-place structure to support the management 
and oversight of services acquisitions. 
2.4.3.  Reviews and coordinates documentation relating to services acquisitions prior to 
submission to SAF/AQ or SAF/SQ. 
2.4.4.  Dedicates and prepares full-time Program Directors within the AFPEO/CM 
organization who are responsible for coordinating services acquisitions and managing day-to-
day activities for assigned organizations. These personnel are liaisons who build relationships 
between SADAs, their respective teams, and the SSM. 
2.5.  Services Acquisition Decision Authority (SADA).  The SADA is the accountable senior 
leader responsible for the execution, management, and oversight of services acquisitions in each 
S-CAT identified in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 within their portfolio and/or expressed in an SMA. SADAs
may delegate all, some, or none of their SADA authorities, but still retain overall responsibility for
services acquisitions in their portfolio. The SADA shall:
2.5.1.  Exercise authority for acquisition decisions including but not limited to: 
2.5.1.1.  The overall management and execution of services acquisitions, the degree of 
services acquisition maturity, continuous process improvement, the workforce 
qualifications and experience to manage services acquisitions, and the in-place structure to 
support the management and oversight of services acquisitions.

and complexities of the services acquisition and members are appointed for all services 
requirements greater than or equal to the SAT. The responsibilities of the MFT are defined in 
paragraph 2.10. 
2.9.  Requirements Approval Authority (RAA).  The RAA approves services requirements at 
Secretariat, Air Staff, Space Staff, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, FOA, DRU, and S-PEO/TEO levels. 
For the purposes of DAF, the RAA fulfills the SRRB chair role as defined in DoDI 5000.74. The 
RAA establishes a process that incorporates cross-functional representation from requiring 
activity, contracting, financial management, and other pertinent organizations to identify, assess, 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
15 
validate, and approve services requirements. The approval of a requirement allows senior mission 
leaders to prioritize mission requirements to best support their mission needs within available 
funding limits. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 specify the authority levels. (Note: In some cases, the RAA and 
the SADA may be the same person). The RAA shall: 
2.9.1.  Review and approve all Requirements Approval Documents (RADs) greater than or 
equal to the SAT prior to approval of the acquisition strategy for the services being acquired. 
2.9.2.  Ensure all approved RADs that contain depot maintenance requirements are consistent 
with their respective Depot Source of Repair decisions. (See AFMAN 63-122, Depot Source 
of Repair Planning and Activation, 21 January 2020) 
2.10.  Multi-Functional Team (MFT). 
2.10.1.  The MFT is a mission-focused team responsible for developing contract requirements, 
assessing contractor performance, and managing service delivery. The emphasis of the MFT 
is on teamwork, trust, knowledge-sharing, and efficient execution. The MFT is responsible for 
duties in each of the Seven Steps to the Services Acquisition Process outlined in the 
Acquisition of Services pathway (see DoDI 5000.74). 
2.10.2.  This team includes representatives of all the stakeholders involved in the effort. Tailor 
the membership of the MFT to fit the size and complexities of the acquisition. The MFT will 
include the Program Manager (PM) or Services Acquisition Lead (SAL), Requiring Activity 
Representative, Contracting Officer (CO), and Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) 
when assigned or designated. Others should be added to the MFT based on the pre- and post-
award specifics of the program; these include functional/technical subject matter experts, price 
analyst, contract specialist, labor advisor, safety representative, logistics representative, and/or 
Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) representative. Some members may be 
necessary for their contribution to specific documents or tasks; these include the Quality 
Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC), legal advisor, security representative, cybersecurity 
representative, finance representative, COR supervisor, functional commander/director, and/or 
small business representative. 
2.10.3.  The SADA ensures the formation of the MFT. The MFT is led by a PM or by a SAL; 
if by a SAL, with close coordination and assistance from the CO. Members of the MFT are 
accountable to the PM/SAL for the activities related to each member’s functional area. (See 
Chapter 4 and the MFT Resources Guide on the AFPEO/CM SharePoint website for 
additional information). 
2.11.  Program Manager (PM)/ Services Acquisition Lead (SAL).  The PM or SAL is the 
designated individual with the responsibility and authority for managing cost, schedule, 
performance, and risk of services acquisitions. The Department of the Air Force distinguishes 
between DAWIA-certified acquisition PMs and functionals performing the duties of a PM. The 
term Program Manager or PM, as used in this DAFI, refers to a DAWIA-certified PM. A DAWIA-
certified PM is required for Programs greater than or equal to $100M. (T-1) PMs may be appointed 
within the grace period to meet certification required by their position as described in DoDI 
5000.66, Defense Acquisition Workforce Education, Training, Experience, and Career 
Development Program, para 5.1..f. The term SAL describes functionals (i.e., personnel from the 
requiring activity) who perform the duties of a PM. A SAL (or PM if assigned by the SADA) is 
required for all services acquisitions greater than or equal to the SAT and less than $100M. (T-1) 
16 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024

2.12.  Contracting Officer (CO).  The CO is the only person with the authority to obligate the 
Government and direct a contractor’s performance. The CO carries out the requirements identified 
in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements. 
2.12.1.  The CO plans, awards, administers, modifies, interprets, takes corrective action, and 
terminates a contract on behalf of the Government commensurate with the limitations specified 
on the CO’s warrant. 
2.12.2.  As described in DoDI 5000.72, DoD Standard for Contracting Officer’s 
Representative (COR) Certification, Enclosure 3, para 1(c), when applicable, the CO 
designates a properly trained COR in writing. (T-0) COs shall designate a COR for all services 
contracts, unless certain conditions are met, as described in DFARS Procedures, Guidance, 
and Information (PGI) 201.602-2(d)(v)(A), Responsibilities. (T-0) Contracting Officers may 
consider designating alternate CORs as required. COs are responsible for ensuring contract-
specific training is scheduled and provided. Training may be conducted by the CO, Contracting 
Specialist, or QAPC. See DAFFARS MP 5301.602-2(d), Designation, Assignment, and 
Responsibilities of a Contracting Officers Representative (COR), paragraph 1.3. 
2.12.3.  For acquisitions under $50M, the CO documents acquisition planning consistent with 
SADA instructions. 
2.13.  Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  CORs are nominated by the requiring 
activity and, upon contract award, designated by the Contracting Officer.  Requiring activities 
should nominate CORs early in the acquisition process to allow the prospective COR to receive 
required training and to provide timely input before contract award. 
2.13.1.  A COR executes the duties and responsibilities detailed in FAR 1.604, Contracting 
Officer’s Representative (COR), DFARS PGI 201.602, DAFFARS Mandatory Procedure (MP) 
5301.602-2(d), and DoDI 5000.72. (T-0) Specific duties are outlined in the Contracting 
Officer’s COR designation letter. 
2.13.2.  Prospective CORs shall participate, as appropriate, in pre-award requirements 
definition, acquisition planning, and contract formation processes (i.e., market research, 
independent government estimate, justification and approval documentation). (T-3) 
2.13.3.  CORs may utilize subject matter experts (SMEs) to provide additional insight and 
observations to the COR regarding the contractor’s performance. CORs must verify and 
document the observations provided by SMEs; however, CORs shall not appoint, designate, 
re-designate or sub-designate COR duties/responsibilities to other persons. (T-0) 
2.13.4.  CORs will use the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) system to 
maintain documentation of COR training, surveillance activities, and approve contract 
payments. See the DoD COR Guidebook for additional COR guidance. (T-0) 
2.14.  Chief Contracting Officer’s Representative (C-COR).  When a CO or PM/SAL 
determines that a services contract requires more than one COR, the requiring activity may 
nominate, and the contracting officer may designate a C-COR. In addition to the COR 
responsibilities identified in paragraph 2.13, the C-COR manages the activities of all CORs and 
COR Supervisors for a particular contract to ensure compliance with regulatory, quality assurance 
and reporting requirements specified in paragraphs 2.13 and 2.15. 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024

Chapter 3 
REQUIREMENTS APPROVAL PROCESS 
3.1.  Overview.  Congressional and DoD direction dictates every services requirement greater 
than or equal to the SAT be validated. DAF-funded requirements are validated and approved by 
the Requirements Approval Authority (RAA). The RAA establishes a process that incorporates 
cross-functional representation from the requiring, contracting, and financial management 
communities to identify, assess, validate, and approve services requirements. A requirements 
review process is critical to the final cost, schedule, and performance of an acquired service and 
should incorporate current and accurate mission needs, spend data analysis, cost analysis, risk 
analysis, and initial market research. The RAA ensures that services requirements are defined and 
validated in a manner that promotes the most effective use of resources across the DAF enterprise. 
See paragraph 1.1.4 for a full explanation of how the DAF implements the requirement for an 
SRRB. 
3.2.  Requirement Identification.  The requiring activity representative, or assigned PM/SAL, 
documents the need for the proposed requirement and obtains requirements approval from the 
appropriate RAA (see Tables 3.1 and 3.2) as soon as new requirements, follow-on requirements, 
or changes to recurring requirements are identified. 
3.2.1.  If there are multiple requiring activities, follow AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-
Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreement Procedures, to execute a Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) which identifies the requiring activities, the lead organization, PM/SAL 
assigned, and RAA for execution of the acquisition. If the combined requirements total $100M 
or more, the identified lead organization will provide the MOA to the SSM if requested. 
3.2.2.  When the organization determines a need for contracted services, the RAA, as described 
in Section 2.9 and Tables 3.1 and 3.2, approves the requirement via the Requirements 
Approval Document (RAD) prior to approval of the acquisition strategy. This process aligns 
accountability and responsibility of the services requirement within the requiring activity’s 
chain of command. The SADA, through written communication with the RAA, may grant a 
waiver to extend the RAD approval timeline beyond the approval of the acquisition strategy. 
Acquisition teams must explain the extenuating circumstances that require late approval in the 
acquisition strategy documentation. However, the RAD shall be approved prior to the release 
of the solicitation. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.2.3.  For S-PEO/TEO programs of record, requirements approval is captured within the 
mandatory milestone decision documents. The RAA is the assigned Milestone Decision 
Authority (MDA). Clearly written services requirements vetted by the appropriate stakeholders 
early in the life cycle or requirements included in the Acquisition Strategy or Life Cycle 
Sustainment Plan serve as the requirements approval for services. For those services not 
included in the original documentation, an amendment to the milestone documentation or a 
separate RAD is required.

3.3.  Requirement Review and Documentation.  A RAD in the form of a memorandum and/or 
an electronic approval record is mandatory for all services acquisitions applicable to this DAFI, 
unless otherwise exempted (see Chapter 1) or validated by other means (see paragraph 3.2.3.). 
Organizations may mandate the use of the Requirements Application of AFPEO/CM’s Strategic 
Management Tool (SMT) to facilitate the review, approval, and documentation of services 
requirements. 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
23

functions, closely associated with inherently governmental functions, or critical functions. 
(T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.3.2.  The RAD, regardless of form, at a minimum shall document the following information: 
3.3.2.1.  A description of the requirement, anticipated service start date, the need for the 
requirement, and the outcomes to be achieved. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.3.2.2.  A description of how the requirement was previously satisfied and/or what 
changed in the environment to require the need for a contracted solution, if applicable. 
Include a description of the nature and extent of market research conducted. (T-1) 
Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.3.2.3.  The impact to the mission if the RAD is not approved. (T-1)  Exception: S-
PEO/TEO (T-3)
3.3.2.4.  An estimate of the total cost of the potential program including all 
periods, options, and extensions. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.4.  Other RAD Considerations. 
3.4.1.  A RAD is required before a DAF organization may establish an inter-agency agreement 
to fund a requirement. (T-1) 
3.4.2.  A blanket RAD is a requirements approval that spans multiple requirements of a similar 
nature for a program or over the life of a contract vehicle ordering period. 
3.4.3.  RADs for strategic contract vehicles (non-DAF). When using another agency's 
enterprise contract vehicle with decentralized ordering, an appropriately approved DAF RAD, 
or DAF-approved blanket RAD, is required. (T-1) 
3.4.4.  RADs for strategic contract vehicles (DAF). For a DAF contract vehicle with 
decentralized ordering, an appropriately approved DAF RAD, or DAF-approved blanket RAD, 
is required for the award of the basic contract executed by the procuring organization. (T-1) 
24 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
RAD amount will be for the entire ceiling value based on anticipated users. A separate RAD 
must be executed for task orders not included in the original contract RAD value. (T-1) 
3.4.5.  If the funding agency and the requiring activity are different, the RAD processing shall 
follow the processes and procedures established by the requiring activity’s management 
structure. The RAD shall be coordinated through the funding agency prior to approval. 
Requirement approval is not dependent on funding availability. (T-1) 
3.4.5.1.  Installation and Mission Support service requirements ≥$10M that are resourced 
by Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC) and wholly funded 
through Operating Agency Codes (OAC)-18 account elements shall be approved by the 
appropriate AFIMSC authority, regardless of the MAJCOM/FLDCOM executing the 
requirement. (T-2) The requirement shall be assessed, reviewed, and validated by the 
owning MAJCOM/FLDCOM before AFIMSC approval. Owning MAJCOM/FLDCOM 
must coordinate on the RAD prior to AFIMSC approval. (T-2)  
3.4.5.2.  Requirements ≥$10M that are partially funded by OAC-18 account elements shall 
follow the respective MAJCOM/FLDCOM’s requirement approval process. RAD shall 
also be coordinated with AFIMSC. (T-2) 
3.4.5.3.  AFIMSC approval authorities are defined by the MAJCOM/FLDCOM RAA 
structure (see Tables 3.1 and 3.2.), Air Force Materiel Command SMA, and further written 
delegations. 
3.5.  Acquisitions with Different Execution and Funding Organizations. 
3.5.1.  DAF requirements executed by a non-DAF entity, to include Assisted Acquisitions, 
require an approved RAD.  Non-DAF requirements executed by a DAF entity require 
documented evidence of requirement approval. Non-DAF requirement approval may follow 
the processes and procedures established by the non-DAF organization. (T-1) Exception: S-
PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.5.2.  If an acquisition solution to use a non-DAF procuring office to satisfy customer 
requirements is determined to be in the best interest of the DAF, the requiring activity 
representative or the assigned PM/SAL shall submit a RAD (approved by the RAA) (see para 
3.4.1). (T-1) The approved RAD along with a SADA memorandum approving the use of a 
non-DAF procuring office must be included with any applicable Military Interdepartmental 
Purchase Request (MIPR) package. Organizations may use their own format for the SADA 
memo. 
3.5.3.  When a DAF entity serves as the procuring organization for a non-DAF entity, the 
procuring organization shall obtain a copy of a signed host tenant support agreement or MOA. 
The agreement must reflect the current environment of the scope of requirements or number 
of resources available to support procurement of the requirement and contract administration 
for the life of the contract vehicle. (T-2) If the agreement does not reflect the current 
environment of the scope of requirements or number of resources available to support, then 
the principal parties shall revisit the agreement. (T-2) If no host tenant support agreement or 
MOA exists, an agreement shall be written which acknowledges an awareness of the 
requirement and that the procuring organization has both the willingness and adequate 
personnel to support procurement of the requirement. (T-2) See AFI 25-201 and DoDI 
4000.19, Support Agreements, for more information. 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024

3.6.  Amended Requirements. 
3.6.1.  An amended RAD is required when the value of the approved service exceeds the 
approval authority of the RAA who approved the initial RAD. Include the initial RAD in the 
amended RAD approval package. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3) 
3.6.2.  When the value of the acquisition exceeds 25% of the approved RAD but does not 
exceed the approval authority of the RAA, the PM/SAL shall inform both the SADA and the 
RAA of the value increase in writing. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3)  
3.6.3.  When there are changes to the scope of the original requirement that were not 
contemplated when the initial RAD was approved, the initial RAD will be canceled and a 
new RAD must be processed for the entire requirement. (T-1) Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3)

DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
Chapter 4 
SERVICES ACQUISITION PROCESS 
4.1.  Overview.  The Services Acquisition Process starts when an organization identifies a mission 
requirement that can best be satisfied by contract and acquisition objectives defined by the 
requiring activity. Acquisition success depends largely on the preparation and planning conducted 
by the MFT prior to solicitation and award. The PM/SAL leads the MFT through the Seven Steps 
to the Services Acquisition Process to ensure proven, repeatable processes and procedures as 
described in DoDI 5000.74. The seven steps should be implemented in a manner consistent with 
the complexity and dollar value of an acquisition. Acquisition planning, market and enterprise 
research, and risk assessment, shall occur early and continuously throughout the acquisition 
process. The MFT is responsible for assessing, documenting, measuring, and reporting post-award 
service provider performance. Organizations may mandate the use of the Services Acquisitions 
application of AFPEO/CM’s SMT to create, manage, and track the services acquisition and 
contract information. Additional information on the Seven Steps to the Services Acquisition 
Process may be found on the AFPEO/CM SharePoint website. (see References in Attachment 1) 
4.2.  Acquisition Planning (Steps 1 and 2).  The MFT (led by the PM/SAL) shall complete 
acquisition planning activities to include forming the team, developing a team charter (see 
paragraph 2.11.3), defining the scope of the requirement with the requiring activity, establishing 
schedule, assessing past strategies and their effectiveness, assessing current performance (if 
reacquiring services), identifying stakeholders, and conducting a risk assessment. (T-1) Services 
acquisition planning and coordination activities shall allow sufficient time to develop or re-validate 
services requirements consistent with the requiring activity stated objectives. 
4.2.1.  Metrics. MFTs shall employ performance management metrics to achieve efficiencies 
in procurement of services using performance-based services contracting, competition, 
program review spend analyses, and improved management of services contracts. MFTs 
should tailor specific metrics to the needs of the requiring activity. Metrics must track and 
measure performance effectively, support and inform acquisition planning, and be considered 
during the requirement review and approval process. 
4.2.2.  Services Acquisition Workshop (SAW). See DoDI 5000.74 for MFT requirement to 
participate in a SAW provided by DAU. The DAF SSM waives the specific SAW requirement 
for all task orders greater than or equal to $100M and less than $500M unless the acquisition 
is determined special interest. 
4.2.3.  Assisted Acquisitions. The use of an assisted acquisition to satisfy a requirement may 
also be introduced during the acquisition planning phase. When an assisted acquisition solution 
is determined by the MFT to be the best approach, seek SADA approval in writing. Personnel 
from the assisting organization will participate in all pre-award and post-award phases of the 
acquisition according to their defined roles. Any authorities being delegated to an outside 
agency shall be delegated in writing. (T-1) Assisted acquisitions require a Fiscal Service (FS) 
Form 7600A, Agreement Between Federal Program Agencies for Intragovernmental 
Reimbursable, Buy/Sell Activity, detailing the roles and responsibilities of the requesting office 
and supporting acquisition office. An MOA may be used to further detail terms and conditions 
in addition to the FS Form 7600A. Recommend use of an MOA for DAF intra-agency 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
27 
acquisitions. Adhere to AFI 65-118 for all assisted acquisitions that require acquisition support 
outside of the DAF. 
4.3.  Market and Enterprise Research (Step 3).  MFTs shall follow the market research policies 
and procedures in FAR Part 10, Market Research. (T-0) When executing a new or follow-on 
strategic/enterprise vehicle, market research will likely require more in-depth assessments of the 
marketplace, including DAF’s enterprise leverage, potential industry partners, and how to align 
with commercial best practices. MFTs shall engage with industry early and often to inform 
acquisition strategies that maximize competition, consider opportunities for small business and 
AbilityOne non-profit agency (see FAR 8.705-1, Procedures) participation, and increase reliance 
on commercial capabilities and technologies. MFTs shall consider strategic sourcing and use of 
enterprise vehicles, such as pre-existing contracts (inter- and intra-agency contracts), to fulfill 
services requirements before awarding new contracts (see FAR 7.102(a)(4), Policy). (T-0) 
4.4.  Early Strategy and Issues Session (ESIS).  The purpose of an ESIS is to facilitate a candid 
and collaborative working session to discuss ideas, best practices, and significant acquisition 
issues. An ESIS is not meant to establish an acquisition strategy or to solicit a decision but serves 
as a vector-check from senior leaders prior to solidifying the acquisition strategy. The MFT should 
formally document any direction provided by the SADA for the acquisition. An ESIS is mandatory 
for all services acquisitions greater than or equal to $100M and is recommended for services 
acquisitions below $100M. (T-1)  
4.4.1.  ESIS participants from the MFT include the requiring activity representative, SADA, 
PM/SAL, contracting personnel, and other relevant MFT members (e.g., current COR (follow-
on requirements), prospective COR (new requirements), financial management (FM), small 
business (SB), legal, security, manpower, safety). 
4.4.2.  When establishing milestones, schedule the ESIS after preliminary market research is 
conducted and no later than 90 calendar days prior to the ASP. (T-3) SADAs may approve 
earlier ASP briefings. 
4.4.3.  Consider holding a follow-on ESIS if market research or other considerations lead the 
team in a new direction that is more advantageous for the acquisition. If a follow-on ESIS is 
not feasible, discuss post-ESIS changes during the ASP briefing. 
4.5.  Requirements Definition (Step 4).  MFTs shall align services requirements with the stated 
requiring activity objectives. Requirements shall be written in a performance-based manner 
supporting measurable cost, schedule, and performance outcomes tied to service quality and 
delivery. Integrate the results of risk analysis to assist in shaping the performance-based 
requirements. Performance-based requirements provide industry flexibility in meeting services 
requirements while relying on industry best practices and standards, where possible. Requirements 
shall be stated in terms of what is to be accomplished (result), rather than how to accomplish the 
work (method). Requiring activity representatives shall ensure that any citation to an instruction 
or directive within a performance work statement (PWS) is specific and does not reference the 
entire publication. The CO should share draft PWSs with industry for review and feedback. 
4.5.1.  The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) measures a contractor’s performance 
against PWS requirements. See Chapter 6 for Quality Oversight. 
4.5.2.  MFTs shall develop an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) to be submitted 
with the requirement package to Contracting. An IGCE is the Government’s estimate of the 
28 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
contractor’s projected price for the successful performance of the contract. IGCE format and 
contents will vary depending on the complexity and value of the requirement and cost 
estimating technique employed, such as analogous, parametric, and bottom-up. IGCEs should 
be treated as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Accurate IGCEs are critical for use 
in source selections, sole source negotiations, budget planning, and future requirement 
changes. Common elements of costs found in an IGCE include labor skill mix, hours, direct 
and indirect costs based on service levels, frequency of performance, and quality levels. 
4.5.3.  The PM/SAL is responsible for leading the development and coordination of 
requirements with functional SMEs. 
4.5.3.1.  Representatives from all applicable functional disciplines will support the 
PM/SAL in defining the requirement. 
4.5.3.2.  The PM/SAL shall include applicable safety, security, intelligence supportability, 
statutory, and regulatory requirements associated with contracted services as appropriate. 
Specific instructions that must be reviewed with airworthiness and safety SMEs are: 
4.5.3.2.1.  DAFI 62-601, Airworthiness. As applicable, include airworthiness 
requirements in the PWS. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.2.  Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210.1, Contractor’s 
Flight and Ground Operations. As applicable, include flight and ground safety 
Contractor-Owned, Contractor Operated air services requirements in the PWS. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.3.  AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. As applicable, 
include safety reviews/processes, systems safety and safety risk assessments and 
acceptance, in the PWS. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.4.  DAFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. As applicable, include 
mishap investigation and reporting responsibilities in the PWS. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.5.  AFI 63-101/20-101, paragraph 4.16.. As applicable, include critical 
intelligence supportability requirements in the PWS. (T-1) 
4.6.  Acquisition Strategy (Step 5). 
4.6.1.  Ensure the services acquisition strategy aligns with mission objectives and establishes 
a methodology that optimizes and drives performance. The selected contract type, source 
selection procedures, and contract incentives (if used) shall align to stated requirements and 
objectives. Consider applicable fees when contemplating use of inter-agency vehicles. Non-
performance based requirements and strategies shall be approved by the SADA (see 
paragraph 2.5.2.). Organizations shall use templates established by AFPEO/CM for briefings 
identified below (see References in Attachment 1). All templates are tailorable to specific 
organizational acquisitions. The assigned AFPEO/CM Program Director shall be invited to 
attend all ESIS and ASP briefings for services acquisitions greater than or equal to $100M. 
4.6.2.  Acquisition Plan (AP) and Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP). The acquisition strategy 
shall be documented in a comprehensive, integrated acquisition plan covering all cost, 
schedule, technical, business, and support strategies to manage program risks and meet 
program objectives. (T-0) Develop evaluation criteria that allow the Government to make 
meaningful differentiations among proposals ensuring consistency and linkage between the 
PWS and the finalized solicitation. DFARS 207.103 determines when a written AP is required. 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
29 
Prepare the AP as described in FAR 7.105, DFARS 207.105, and DAFFARS 5307.105, 
Contents of Written Acquisition Plans, and DAFFARS 5307.104-92. ASP briefing charts 
satisfy the requirement for a written AP only when they satisfy the requirements of FAR 7.105 
and DFARS 207.105. 
4.7.  Execute Acquisition Strategy (Step 6).  The acquisition strategy is executed by the MFT. 
The strategy may include a variety of approaches to meet mission requirements. Acquisitions may 
be competitive or non-competitive in nature.  In either case, the MFT shall follow the applicable 
business and contract clearance procedures defined in DAFFARS 5301.90, Clearance. (T-0) 
Competitive acquisition strategies are preferred. When necessary to procure through non-
competitive means, see FAR 6, Competition Requirements. When execution will be accomplished 
using a competitive source selection process, the acquisition will be accomplished as described in 
FAR 15.3, Source Selection, the Department of Defense Source Selection Procedures, and 
DAFFARS MP 5315.3, Source Selection. (T-0) 
4.8.  Post-Award Performance Management (Step 7). 
4.8.1.  This step ensures effective management of cost, schedule, performance, and risk after 
contract award. The PM/SAL will ensure continued participation by the MFT during contract 
administration. The CO and PM/SAL should conduct a post-award conference (kick-off 
meeting) with the MFT and the contractor team members to ensure a common understanding 
of services requirements, expectations, and responsibilities of all members. The PM/SAL shall

Chapter 6 
QUALITY OVERSIGHT 
6.1.  Overview.  The Government’s role in quality oversight is to ensure it receives the services 
contracted for and only pays for the services received. The Government’s approach to quality is 
documented in the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). The type and extent of contract 
quality requirements needed depends on the service being acquired (see FAR 46.201, Contract 
Quality Requirement, General). Solicitations and contracts may provide for alternative, but 
substantially equivalent, inspection methods to obtain wide competition and low cost. However, 
the CO may authorize contractor recommended inspection alternatives when in the Government's 
interest and approved by the requiring activity. Quality is the responsibility of the services 
contractor, not the Government. A guiding principle to quality is that the COR’s level of 
surveillance is commensurate with the level of risk associated with contractor performance. 
6.1.1.  Contract quality requirements for services above the SAT fall into three general 
categories, depending on the extent of quality assurance needed by the Government for the 
acquisition. 
6.1.1.1.  Contracts for commercial services. The Government shall rely on the contractor 
to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that commercial services acquired 
conform to contract requirements before they are tendered to the Government (see clause 
at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Products and 
Commercial Services). 
6.1.1.2.  Standard inspection requirements. Contractors provide an acceptable inspections 
system, give the Government the right to inspect, and keep complete records of inspection 
work. Services related clauses include FAR 52.246-4, Inspection of Services-Fixed-Price; 
FAR 52.246-5, Inspection of Services-Cost Reimbursement; and 52.246-6, Inspection-
Time-and-Material and Labor-Hour. 
6.1.1.3.  Higher-level contract quality requirements. Requiring higher-level quality 
standards may be necessary in solicitations and contracts for complex or critical services 
(see FAR 46.202-4, Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirements, and clause at FAR 
52.246-11, Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirement). Higher-level contract quality 
requirements are used in addition to standard inspection requirement (see DFARS 246.202-
4, Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirements). 
6.1.2.  Background. Sections 4501, 4502, and 4505 of Title 10, United States Code (USC) 
mandate 
Performance-Based 
Services 
Acquisition 
goals, 
cost 
savings, 
and 
a 
management/oversight structure for services acquisitions similar to the procurement of 
products. 
6.1.3.  Additional Information. The MFT Resources Guide on the AFPEO/CM SharePoint site 
(see References in Attachment 1) provides greater detail and best practices for quality 
oversight information and MFT roles and responsibilities. 
6.2.  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). 
6.2.1.  Purpose. The purpose of a QASP is to provide a documented process for surveilling the 
contractor's actual performance and comparing that to the technical requirements of the 
34 
DAFI63-138  2 JANUARY 2024 
contract. The QASP identifies and describes the roles and responsibilities for implementing 
and maintaining the key elements of contract performance management and surveillance. 
6.2.2.  QASP Development. The QASP is developed based on the surveillance necessary to 
assess contractor compliance to PWS requirements. Mission essential/critical Services 
Summary (SS) items with measurable performance thresholds shall be included in the PWS. 
The MFT ensures the QASP includes the SS items with performance objectives (acceptable 
quality levels), surveillance methods, and surveillance frequency. Other PWS/contract items 
are included within the QASP for surveillance, on an as needed basis, to ensure PWS coverage. 
Furthermore, the QASP identifies how CORs link surveillance of SS items to periodic 
surveillance reporting and to CPARS reporting. The QASP may be shared with the contractor 
to provide transparency regarding the Government’s surveillance methodology but shall not 
be part of the resulting contract. 
6.2.3.  QASP Related Requirements: QASP-related requirements are addressed in several 
regulatory, procedural, instructional, and guidance documents. These documents should be 
consulted for each acquisition to determine an appropriate QASP approach. Consult FAR Parts 
12, Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services, 37, Service Contracting, 
and 46, Quality Assurance; DFARS 237.172, Service contracts surveillance, and 246.401, 
Government Contract Quality Assurance; DFARS PGIs 222.1703(4), Combating Trafficking 
In Persons, Policy, and 237.172, Service contracts surveillance; DAFFARS MP 5301.602-
2(d) and 5346.103; the MFT Resources Guide on the AFPEO/CM SharePoint site; and any 
applicable functional community guidance (e.g., DAFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment 
Maintenance Management, for aircraft maintenance community) for QASP requirements. This 
is not an all-inclusive list. 
6.2.4.  DoD has mandated use of the Joint Appointment Module (JAM) and the Surveillance 
and Performance Monitoring Module (SPM) within the Procurement Integrated Enterprise 
Environment (PIEE) system for all contracts for which a COR has been designated. (T-0) See 
DoDI 5000.72 for further information. 
6.3.  Actions to Address Substandard Services and Contractual Non-Conformities.  The types 
of corrective actions available to the Government for contractor services not meeting contract 
requirements will be prescribed in the contract. When developing the solicitation, the MFT shall 
carefully consider which contract terms, conditions, and clauses should be included in the contract 
to allow substandard service and non-conformities to be appropriately addressed. (T-2) 
Exception: S-PEO/TEO (T-3)
