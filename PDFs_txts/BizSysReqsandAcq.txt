This supplement implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1_20-1, Integrated Life 
Cycle Management, and supplements guidance in Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 
(DoDI) 5000.75, Business Systems Requirements and Acquisition. The DoDI is printed word-
for-word in regular font without editorial review.  Air Force supplementary material is 
printed in bold font and indicated by “(Added)(DAF).” This publication applies to all civilian 
employees and uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air 
National Guard (ANG), United States Space Force (USSF), and those who are contractually 
obligated to comply with Department of the Air Force (DAF) publications. ANG Note: This 
policy does not apply to ANG/assets unless ordered to federal duty or subject to the approval 
of The Adjutant General of the Several States. This DAFI does not request support from 
ANG to take any action that incurs a manpower, or any other cost not already incurred 
internally, had a Functional Sponsor provided a requirement and/or funding to initiate or 
continue a DBS program. This policy does not require any ANG action until ANG internally 
has decided it has a requirement and funding to initiate or continue such a DBS program. 
This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements must be routed to 
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) listed above for coordination prior to 
certification and approval.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this 
publication to the OPR listed above using the DAF Form 847, Recommendation for Change 
of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate chain of 
command.  The authorities to waive wing, unit, delta, or garrison level requirements that are

outside of the acquisition execution chain in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-
0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See DAF Manual (DAFMAN) 
90-161, Publishing Processes and Procedures, for a description of the authorities associated
with the Tier numbers and waiver processing procedures. Submit requests for waivers
through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or
alternately, to the requestor’s commander for non-tiered, non-acquisition execution
compliance items using a completed DAF Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item
Waiver Request/Approval (or equivalent information). Commanders or equivalent may
waive non-tiered requirements, but must send a copy of the approved waiver to the
publication OPR within 30 days of approval for situational awareness and process
improvement consideration. Mandates to the acquisition execution chain as described in AFI
63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, are not elevated through the
organizational chain of authority; therefore, tiering in accordance with DAFMAN 90-161 is
not applicable and the waiver authority is as specified.  Ensure all records generated as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force Instruction 33-322,
Records Management and Information Governance Program, and are disposed in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is located in the Air
Force Records Information Management System.
Summary Of Changes  
This publication has been rewritten as a supplement and revised to reflect stand up of USSF, 
incorporation of guidance on agile software development, introduce Business Mission Area 
program types and use of a Business Service Catalog and address updated governance 
processes. Changes include the elaboration of tailored approaches to different business 
capability requests and a shift toward an enterprise approach governing the Business 
Mission Area and Defense Business Systems.

SECTION 1: GENERAL ISSUANCE INFORMATION 
1.1. APPLICABILITY. 
This issuance applies to: 
a. OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other 
organizational entities within the DoD (referred to collectively in this issuance as the 
“DoD Components”). 
b. All defense business capabilities and their supporting business systems, including those
with “as-a-service” (aaS) solutions. Chief Management Officer (CMO) certification 
requirements in this issuance apply to business systems only. 
c. (Added)(DAF) The processes and requirements in this Supplement apply to all
business capability and systems regardless of funding level and appropriation except those 
developmental software efforts meeting the criteria for and choosing to implement using 
DoDI 5000.87, Software Acquisition Pathway. Note: Statutory requirements that apply to 
Defense Business Systems (DBS) will also apply to DBS programs using DoDI 5000.87 
unless otherwise noted in statute. 
d. (Added)(DAF) Business system programs may include the acquisition of services.
Review AFI 63-138, The Acquisition of Services, for additional guidance. 
1.2. POLICY. 
It is DoD policy that: 
a. DoD acquisition of business systems will be aligned to commercial or government
best practices and will minimize the need for customization of commercial products to the 
maximum extent practicable. Thorough industry analysis and market research of both process 
and information technology (IT) are expected. 
b. Business systems acquisition will facilitate business changes through doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy 
to drive performance improvements, efficiencies, effectiveness, cyber resilience, and 
audit compliance. 
c. Business systems acquisition is the joint responsibility of the functional and the
acquisition communities. Both communities are accountable for the successful delivery of 
business capability, from business process design through business system deployment and 
capability support. Functional and acquisition leadership emphasis on change management 
is essential for success, and all leaders must drive toward commercial off-the-shelf 
(COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions, to the extent practicable. 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023

d. The acquisition pathway described in this issuance may be used for other non- 
developmental, software intensive programs (including national security systems, productivity 
solutions, and IT infrastructure), when approved in program acquisition strategies. Statutory 
requirements for other types of IT capabilities developed in accordance with this issuance will 
still apply. CMO certification requirements in this issuance apply to business systems only. 
e. The authority to proceed (ATP) decision points of the BCAC portrayed in Figure 1
provide the framework for acquisition and business decisions in the life cycle and may be tailored 
as necessary to contribute to successful delivery of business capabilities.  
Figure 1.  Business Capability Acquisition Cycle 
f. Decision authorities in Table 3 of Appendix 4A of this issuance will tailor the application
of regulatory requirements and procedures to best achieve capability outcomes, consistent with 
established statutory requirements outlined in Table 4 of Appendix 4A. In addition, decision 
authorities will reduce separate reviews and approvals by other organizations when confirmation 
through direct collaboration is sufficient. 
(1) (Added)(DAF) Capability initiatives will enter into the Capability Need
Identification phase but may transition to other phases if the intent and exit criteria for 
each phase is completed to the satisfaction of the authority to proceed (ATP) approval 
authority. 
(2) (Added)(DAF) Phases are not required to be done in sequence, the process is
iterative and activities for one phase may be initiated or completed in parallel with another 
phases.    
(3) (Added)(DAF) In general, ATP decision points are exit events authorizing
continuation into the next phase. For example a Functional Requirements ATP is 
completed as part of the Business Solution Analysis phase to authorize entry to the 
Functional Requirements and Acquisition Phase.   
g. (Added)(DAF) CCA compliance will be accomplished as an iterative process as
all information may not be available during early ATP decision points. Full CCA 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
10 
compliance (i.e., compliance with all CCA criteria) is required no later than the first 
Limited Deployment ATP. More information on CCA compliance is in Paragraph 2.9.a 
and Table 4 of Appendix 4A. Reference AFMAN 17-1402, Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) 
Compliance and AFI 63-101/20-101 for additional information on CCA. 
1.3. SUMMARY OF CHANGE 2. 
This change clarifies policy, responsibilities, procedures, and definitions to address updates to 
Section 2430(a) of Title 10, U.S.C., gaps in current business systems policy as a result of 
lessons learned, evolving acquisition practices (including DoD’s Adaptive Acquisition 
Framework and 5000-series initiatives), and changes to other business systems-relevant 
issuances. This change also updates references and organizational symbols, and corrects other 
administrative concerns.

DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
20 
e. Chief Information Officer (CIO).
The CIO role will be performed by the DoD CIO or DoD Component CIO depending 
upon the BCAT and any delegation.  The appropriate CIO: 
(1) Confirms CCA compliance based on program manager input and supporting
artifacts through proactive engagement, participating as early as practical in the life cycle. 
This ensures a continuous monitoring approach for CCA and cybersecurity compliance 
instead of conducting a checklist assessment at the end of each life cycle phase. CIO will 
confirm that CCA compliance is on track during the early BCAC phases using a tailored 
approach because not all information may be available yet and will base their decision on 
information in the program’s capability implementation plan, defined in Appendix 4B. 
(2) Assists with determination of cybersecurity controls and reviews and approves
the cybersecurity strategy at the appropriate delegation level before ATP decision points or 
development contract awards. 
(3) Establishes standards and supports determination of program IT infrastructure
solutions and hosting requirements, encouraging shared infrastructure solutions and cloud-
based solutions first with the appropriate program executive officer or service provider. 
(4) Works with the functional lead and program manager to ensure agile or
incremental software development processes are used to the greatest extent practical. 
f. Functional Lead.
The functional lead: 
(1) Leads business process reengineering and execution of business process changes.
(2) Leads definition of functional requirements and training and deployment for
the business capability. 
(3) Reports to the functional sponsor and collaborates with the program manager.
g. Program Manager.
The program manager: 
(1) Leads development and delivery of the business system that supports the delivery
of business capability. 
(2) Provides input to the functional sponsor on process design, requirements,
training and other matters that may influence the acquisition strategy for business systems. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) Identifies specific information and/or data associated with the
business system, new capabilities, or integration that should be restricted from public 
release and develop protection requirements (i.e., Controlled Unclassified). (T-1)

h. (Added)(DAF) Information Technology Portfolio Owner (also known as Functional
CIO).
(1) (Added)(DAF) Performs the responsibilities defined in AFI 17-110.
(2) (Added)(DAF) Develops functional roadmap(s) that describe the portfolio
target state to allow for visibility in how new capability integrates into the functional 
portfolio. (T-1) 
(3) (Added)(DAF) Provides guidance on the prioritization of business system
initiatives within their portfolio. (T-2) 
(4) (Added)(DAF) Prepares annual Organizational Execution Plan (OEP)
submissions for programs within its functional portfolio (e.g., acquisition, finance, etc.)

SECTION 4: PROCEDURES 
4.1. OVERVIEW. 
a. Tailoring.
The procedures used to develop business capability requirements and supporting systems 
will be tailored to the characteristics of the capability being acquired. Tailoring will focus on 
application of best practices to the totality of circumstances associated with the program, 
including affordability, urgency, return on investment, and risk factors, when the requirements 
are not statutory. 
(1) Tailoring should be considered throughout the life cycle from both the functional
and acquisition perspective, to include program strategies and oversight, program information, 
acquisition phase content, and the timing and scope of decision reviews and decision levels. 
(2) The MDA may tailor acquisition content (i.e., acquisition strategy content) for
all BCAC phases. Information requirements supporting requirements validation and the 
CMO certification process cannot be tailored and must be provided to decision makers as 
prescribed. 
(3) Statutory requirements for business systems are outlined in Table 4 of Appendix
4A and may not be waived or tailored unless the statute permits. 
(4) (Added)(DAF) Appendix 4E outlines the DAF’s implementation of BCAC in
five phases and prescribes mandatory steps within a tailorable framework. Each of these 
steps can be tailored to provide only the essential information. 
(5) (Added)(DAF) The appropriate Functional Sponsor or Program Manager
reviews the tailoring, with approval given by the requisite decision authority for each 
decision point. (T-0) 
(6) (Added)(DAF) The tailoring procedures in DAF’s implementation of BCAC lay
out mandatory steps for all initiatives and programs as well as additional steps dependent 
upon the business capability request type. Each of these steps can be tailored to provide 
only the essential required information. 
b. ATP Decision Points.
Decisions will be informed by measures that assess the readiness to proceed to the next 
phase of the process. Decision-making will focus on executability and effectiveness of 
planned activities, including cost, schedule, performance, acquisition strategy, incentive 
structure and risk. 
(1) Decisions are coordinated across key stakeholders and made in a collective forum
so that the decision authority is fully informed by the stakeholders at each decision point. 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
23 
(2) Decision authority is determined by phase content and type of decision being
made. Decision authorities are described in more detail by phase in this section and 
summarized in Table 3 of Appendix 4A. 
(3) After the Functional Requirements ATP, the timing and number of all
subsequent decision points are established as part of the capability implementation plan, 
defined in Appendix 4B. 
(4) ATP decisions must be documented for the record. Approval is based upon
component representation that it has satisfied all statutory, regulatory, and any additional 
critical requirements unless otherwise stated. Information supporting the decision must be 
maintained in accordance with DoD records management procedures. 
(5) Considerations for decision criteria to use in support of ATP decision points
are included in Table 5 of Appendix 4A. 
(6) (Added)(DAF) The Functional Sponsor, Functional Portfolio Lead (Information
Technology Portfolio Owner), or Program Manager may initiate the ATP process when 
ready to submit the content required for that decision point to the decision 
authority/authorities. 
(7) (Added)(DAF) At each decision point the requester will provide the decision
authorities a response to the content reviews with a description of the updates to the 
content and the mitigation plan. The decision authorities decide to: allow the program to 
proceed; proceed with conditions; direct that the program return to another point in the 
process; or halt the program completely. All decisions are recorded in a decision 
memorandum. (T-1) 
(a) (Added)(DAF) Decisions should be data driven, not documentation based,
and are tailorable based on the individual capability effort. Decisions will be presented to 
the functional portfolio board.   
(b) (Added)(DAF) ATP decisions coming from the functional portfolio board,
including but not limited to tailoring considerations, compliance requirements, and other 
agreements, will be documented in an ATP memorandum. (T-0)   
c. Governance.
Governance for business capabilities is not a one-size-fits-all model and must be adaptive, 
transparent, and inclusive of key stakeholders to enable rapid decision making on key matters 
such as requirements, cost, schedule, performance, and risk. Simplified and effective 
governance driven by clear outcomes throughout the capability life cycle is encouraged, as is 
delegating governance decisions to the lowest practical levels. 
(1) (Added)(DAF) The Functional Portfolio Boards (PBs) are a collaborative
forum for functional senior leadership to provide support and operational oversight for 
their BMA portfolio. The PBs ensure key BMA-related decisions align with the Air 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
24 
Force’s overall business direction and priorities as set by the BMA Council.  The 
Functional PBs are partnerships with SAF/MG, SAF/CN, SAF/AQ, PEO BES, PEO 
Command, Control, Intelligence, and Network (C3I&N), and other entities as 
appropriate. PBs serve as the single point of authority for all functional portfolio-level 
decisions. The PBs are the focal points for functional management review and decision-
making risks that are beyond the authority of the program-level leadership. The 
Functional Portfolio Boards provide oversight and guidance for their respective 
Functional Program Review Groups. Additionally, the IT Portfolio Owner and others as 
designated participate in the BMA Council sessions. 
(2) (Added)(DAF) BMA Enterprise Review Groups (BERG) established at
the Executive, Portfolio and Program levels, provide PEO and SAF/MG level 
oversight for DAF Defense Business System ATP decisions. The BERGs are also a 
vehicle for SAF/MG to request periodic status briefings on program progress 
outside of an ATP review requirement.  The lead decision authority for each ATP 
decision will determine the governance forum for each decision review.   
(a) (Added)(DAF) Executive BERGs will review Business System
Category content and serve as the Air Force-level Defense Business Council and 
Defense Acquisition Board equivalent for Development and Modernization 
requirements in accordance with the current annual DAF and MDA guidance 
for programmatic oversight.  
(b) (Added)(DAF) Portfolio and Program level BERGs will be comprised of the
Program Manager(s), the PEO, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), SAF/MG, 
SAF/CN, other appropriate stakeholders, and the functional portfolio owners. These can be 
held in conjunction with functional portfolio meetings or as individual program BERG.    
d. Change Management.
Change management proactively prepares the functional community for upcoming 
changes resulting from the delivery of a business capability, reduces risk, and increases user 
adoption. Change management tasks span the lifecycle of the product’s delivery and include 
the development and delivery of training materials and ongoing capability improvements 
addressed in the capability support phase. The functional lead and program manager are 
jointly responsible for change management. 
e. Budgeting by Functional Capability and IT Portfolio.
Every phase outlined in this document will be funded in the planning, programming, 
budget, and execution process. To facilitate this, functional capability and IT portfolio 
program elements will be established by Components to fund business need definition and 
business solution design efforts.  Funding in the program objective memorandum will 
represent the work to be done across the life cycle, starting with requirements development 
through deployment and capability support. 
f. Continuous Process Improvement.
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
25 
The functional sponsor will engage in continuous process improvement throughout all 
phases of the BCAC, based on opportunities that emerge in analysis of existing capabilities, 
processes, and supporting IT in use within the existing organization and at other organizations. 
The functional sponsor will prioritize these continuous process improvement opportunities for 
current and future initiatives. 
g. Industry Analysis and Market Research.
The functional sponsor and MDA must provide access to domain experts with functional 
and technical knowledge to support analysis of processes from industry and government for 
capability delivery options. These domain experts must guide the development of business 
requirements without preferring business systems over business process improvements. 
Market research will identify existing and emerging business systems available to support 
future processes. 
h. Prototyping and Demonstrations.
To the extent that it benefits the program and at acceptable cost and risk, program 
managers are encouraged to use prototyping and demonstrations to inform requirements, 
support market research, and support selection of products and services.  Program managers 
will provide the MDA with the expected benefits that these efforts will provide as well as the 
approach for making any prototypes operational, as appropriate. 
i. Delivery of Capability.
Functional leads and program managers will apply commercial best practices and lessons 
learned to prioritize and more rapidly develop and deploy useable, affordable subsets of 
capability. 
(1) A release is a manageable subset of functionality, such as minimum viable
product, that provides utility in support of the business capability. Based on the program’s 
particular baselining approach, releases will be baselined and documented in the capability 
implementation plan, as defined in Appendix 4B. The utility provided by a release does not 
have to fulfill the entire business capability. Additional utility may be added through iterative 
releases based on user feedback to minimize risk and increase adoption. 
(2) A deployment either introduces a new release into the production environment
or expands the user base of existing functionality. Deployment includes training and 
business systems operations activities such as help desk support. 
j. Integrated Testing.
The MDA will oversee an effective yet efficient testing approach that incorporates: 
(1) Integrated testing, in which a single test activity can provide data to satisfy
multiple objectives, as supported by an integrated testing strategy documented in the 
capability implementation plan defined in Appendix 4B. Integrated testing may include 
combined contractor and government developmental testing, as well as integrated 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
26 
government developmental and operational testing. 
(2) The use of test automation, to the greatest extent practical.
(3) Involvement of users and testers throughout the entire life cycle.
(4) When supported by the appropriate risk analysis, assessments will primarily use
data from integrated test events rather than a dedicated independent operational test event. For 
programs on the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Oversight List, the level 
of test and use of integrated test data, test strategies, as well as dedicated operational test 
events should be approved by DOT&E based upon Guidelines for Operational Test and 
Evaluation of Information and Business Systems. 
(5) (Added)(DAF) DAF Integrated Test Teams perform the responsibilities as
defined in DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. If a 
project or program is authorized to enter the process anywhere other than the beginning 
(e.g., entry at Phase 4), review all activities that would normally be accomplished prior to 
that point and ensure any mandatory prerequisites are accomplished.  The Integrated 
Test Team reviews and recommends a Lead Development Test and Evaluation 
Organization to the Program Manager. (T-1)  
k. Delegation.
Decision authorities in Table 3 of Appendix 4A will evaluate remaining risk in 
business system programs at each decision point and can delegate authority for specific 
releases or all remaining program capability, to empower leaders to provide timely 
guidance and make decisions at the lowest practical level. 
l. Documentation and Deliverables.
Information requirements will generally not be prepared solely for staff review and 
approval. In addition to supporting decision making at ATP decision points, these products 
should support program activities such as contracting actions or test events, or serve as 
planning and management tools. The information produced will be specific to each program 
and acquisition information (e.g., acquisition strategy content) will be tailored to meet 
individual program needs. Details will be maintained by the program in a transparent and 
timely manner, readily available for reviews as needed. 
m. (Added)(DAF) Agile Implementation.
(1) (Added)(DAF) Where appropriate under the process, PMs will tailor strategies,
process, documentation, design, development, and test activities using agile acquisition 
strategies and techniques. 
(2) (Added)(DAF) PMs should use modern iterative software development
methodologies and techniques as the default approach to the technical implementation of 
business systems.  Iterative software development and DevSecOps methodologies support 
the DoD objective of rapid delivery of capabilities to end user communities at frequent 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
27 
intervals, not only for code development but also for configuration of COTS/GOTS/SaaS 
and aPaaS products and non-IT acquisitions. 
(a) (Added)(DAF) In situations where Agile is deemed not feasible, the chosen
development methodology and justification should be noted in the program’s Capability 
Implementation Plan (CIP) prior to ATP 2.  
(b) (Added)(DAF) At ATP 3 the MDA for programs implmeneting agile
methodologies may delegate ATP decision authority to the delivery manager to 
continuously free flow between BCAC phases 3, 4, and 5 to further aid the use of agile 
methodologies. 
(c) (Added)(DAF) Agile methodologies encourage adapting to increase the
efficiency of the effort. The development team and stakeholders will conduct post sprint 
retrospectives and sprint metrics review to understand sprint velocity, planned vs. executed 
stories and points, changes, and team morale. These metrics will be briefed to a Steering 
Committee. Disciplined sprint metrics gathering and analysis will also help to understand 
and forecast spending for future projects as early as BCAC Phase 2 to include minimum 
viable product, ongoing feature development, backlogs, and future enhancements. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) Business process re-engineering and other continuous process
improvement methodologies will be considered and applied throughout all BCAC phases 
when applying agile methodologies.  
o. (Added)(DAF) Organizational Execution Plans (OEPs) and Out-of-Cycle (OOC)
Requests. 
(1) (Added)(DAF) The IT Portfolio Owner will submit an OEP annually to
SAF/MG to support annual certification of business systems required in 10 United 
States Code § 2222.  The OEP allows SAF/MG to oversee business mission area 
integration, recommend improvement to business operations, and leverage 
appropriate technologies to deliver agile, effective, and efficient business solutions to 
the DAF.  The information necessary to support an OEP is generated as part of the 
BCAC process and integrated into Program Objective Memorandum (POM) 
submission. (T-0)  
(2) (Added)(DAF) Each initiative or investment should be included in an OEP
and undergo analysis during the portfolio management process to ensure: 
(a) (Added)(DAF) The proposed investment is a priority for the DAF and the
BMA community, and the proposed investment supports the BMA Strategy. 
(b) (Added)(DAF) The proposed investment supports the functional strategy
that governs the business domain of the initiative. 
(c) (Added)(DAF) That there is no duplication of effort across initiatives and
encourages reuse of business capabilities, business processes, or IT systems that may 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
28 
already exist or are already under acquisition and deployment. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) SAF/MG is the approval authority for the certification of
funds for DBS.  SAF/MG certification provides the PM (and their reporting chain) 
the legal authority to obligate up to (and not to exceed) the SAF/MG certified level 
by program.  
(4) (Added)(DAF) SAF/MG provides guidance pertaining to each year’s
annual OEP and budget process to include updated requirements and projected 
suspense’s. 
(a) (Added)(DAF) If during the year of execution a program is seeking to
exceed the certified level for the program, an Out-of-Cycle (OOC) request is 
required regardless of the source of the funding (e.g., within the portfolio, external 
customer-funded, etc.). The PM, working through their reporting chain and the 
BMA IT Functional Portfolio Owner, will prepare an OOC package. (T-1)  
(b) (Added)(DAF) If the funds are being moved between programs in the
same portfolio, an OOC is required for both the program gaining the funds as well 
as the program from which the funds are taken. The PM should consider sending a 
draft package to their Functional CIO and SAF/MG portfolio lead for review prior 
to entering formal coordination. SAF/MG conduct BMA Council meetings.  
4.2. BCAC PHASE ACTIVITIES AND DECISION POINTS. 
Figure 2 illustrates the five phases in the process. The BCAC is intended to be cyclical and 
flexible with phases repeating as necessary to drive timely achievement of outcomes.

32 
the program manager with assessing the overall solution approach (e.g., COTS, GOTS, “aaS,” 
legacy modernization, or new development). Meanwhile, the MDA oversees development of 
the acquisition strategy.  An objective of this phase is to establish the acquisition strategy and 
identify the capability support approach required to meet the functional requirements. 
(1) Phase Description.
(a) Functional requirements describe how the business system will achieve the
future business processes. 
(b) The program manager engages further with industry (e.g., market research,
benchmarking, requests for information, industry days) so that functional requirements 
reflect the current state of practice and inform the acquisition strategy. Additional 
information on functional requirements is included in Appendix 4D.

d. Acquisition, Testing, and Deployment.
During this phase, the program manager leads execution of contract award, vendor 
management, establishment of baselines, delivery of the business system, and risk 
management. Meanwhile, the functional sponsor leads training and deployment. The 
objective of this phase is to achieve organizational change through business process changes 
and delivery of the supporting business system, with minimal customization. 
(1) Phase Description.
(a) Detailed fit-gap analysis follows solution selection based on the acquisition
strategy. Fit-gap analysis will be based on the known capabilities of the COTS/GOTS 
software in the selected business system solution. 
(b) Design specifications will reflect fit-gap analysis and prioritization of features
to allow for cost and schedule trades within scope. 
(c) Development, delivery and support activities will be baselined and detailed in
the implementation plan, expressed in terms of releases and deployments. 
1. A limited deployment is any deployment before the Full Deployment ATP
that provides a set of functionality to a set of users of the business system.  The functional 
sponsor and program manager will recommend the functionality and number of users. Limited 
deployments will be approved at a Limited Deployment ATP. 
2. The MDA will require sufficient testing before Limited and Full
Deployment ATPs. For business systems on the DOT&E Oversight List, DOT&E will 
approve all operational test plans, and an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation will be 
conducted before the Full Deployment ATP. 
3. Full deployment is the delivery of full functionality planned to all
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
34 
planned users of the business system in accordance with the Full Deployment ATP. 
(d) The MDA will oversee establishment of cost, schedule and
performance parameters for each release before development or delivery. 
(2) Limited Deployment ATP(s).
At this decision point, the MDA, in conjunction with the functional sponsor, 
considers the results of testing, and approves deployment of the release to limited portions of 
the end user community. Multiple limited deployments may be authorized at the same 
decision point or delegated to a lower decision authority. ATP is executed upon concurrence 
of the functional portfolio board. 
(a) (Added)(DAF) The MDA approves or disapproves deployment to limited
portions of the end user community based on the operational risk associated with the 
release capability. While Limited Deployments do not provide full functionality to all 
planned users of the BCAC, they do require acceptable performance and reliability 
with adequate sustainment and support systems. (T-0) 
(b) (Added)(DAF) The MDA, with support of the Functional Sponsor,
ensures that all components of the materiel solution are properly installed and 
operating; all end users participating in Limited Deployment are adequately trained; a 
Help Desk capability is operational; and the platform environment is prepared to 
support Limited Deployment. (T-1) 
(3) Full Deployment ATP.
At this decision point, the MDA, with the support of the functional sponsor and 
appropriate CMO decision authority, considers the results of limited deployment(s) 
and operational testing and approves deployment to the entire user community. This 
ATP is executed upon concurrence of the functional portfolio board. 
(a) (Added)(DAF) The MDA, with support of the Functional Sponsor and AF
Deputy Chief Management Officer will assess the results documented in the Operational 
Test Report of all Limited Deployments and operational testing and, based on operational 
risk, approve/disapprove deployment to the entire user community. (T-0) 
(b) (Added)(DAF) The Functional Sponsor ensures all elements of the BCAC
solution described in the Capability Implementation Plan are ready to be implemented in 
the operational environment. (T-0) 
(c) (Added)(DAF) After Full Deployment ATP approval, the Program
Manager will deploy all remaining capabilities, Non-Materiel Activities and the IT 
Solution to all end users. (T-1)

portfolio board. 
(2) (Added)(DAF) At this decision point, the Functional Sponsor approves the
Support Plan, which documents the planning for this phase and will be updated 
continuously throughout the program’s useful life. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) This plan also details how the program meets materiel
readiness and operational support performance requirements in the most cost-effective 
manner over its life cycle. 
(5) Information Requirements.
See Appendix 4B for information about the capability implementation plan and 
capability support plan. 
e. Capability Support.
During this phase, the functional sponsor manages and governs the business capability 
and the program manager manages the technical implementation and configuration of the 
business system. The objective of this phase is to provide support for the business 
capability, including continued cybersecurity readiness and enduring support for and 
appropriate upgrades to the business system.

APPENDIX 4B: CAPABILITY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
4B.1. DEFINITION. 
a. The capability implementation plan is an aggregation of the content needed by the
program office to prepare for and manage the delivery of the capability and to support 
statutory and regulatory requirements; it is not a specific document or set of documents. It 
accounts for all necessary information products required to support and inform leadership 
decisions. 
b. Capability implementation plan information will be stored and used by the program
office in whatever applicable format or repository is needed and information will be 
maintained in accordance with records management procedures. Details will be maintained in 
a transparent manner and will be made readily available for reviews as needed. 
c. The capability implementation plan must include or reference the information
requirements developed during early BCAC phases that support requirements validation and 
the CMO certification process. All other implementation plan content (i.e., acquisition 
strategy content), may be tailored to the individual needs of the program unless required by 
statute. 
d. The acquisition strategy content of the implementation plan may need to be
maintained separately to compartmentalize acquisition sensitive information. Similarly, 
technical content concerning cybersecurity may also be maintained separately. 
e. The program may rely on external content such as portfolio procedures to govern
technical management. In this case, the capability implementation plan content supplements 
the portfolio procedures only as needed to tailor the program. 
4B.2. CONTENT. 
Although content will differ from program to program, an effective capability 
implementation plan will include: 
a. References to the capability requirements that the capability implementation
plan supports. 
b. A description of planned decision points with governance details that describe decision
authorities, information requirements that will support the decision, and actions the decision 
will authorize. 
c. A description of business process actions and leaders responsible. Common
business process actions include: 
(1) Implementation of law, regulation, policy or business process changes, including
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
42 
those that do not require business systems and those that must occur before the business 
system can be acquired 
(2) Development of training materials in support of business process changes.
(3) Conduct of user training and deployment in support of the business system.
d. A description of acquisition actions and leaders responsible. Common acquisition
actions include: 
(1) Requests for information, peer reviews, RFPs, and contract awards.
(2) Definition and modeling of functional requirements, inputs and outputs, and
design specifications. 
(3) Software design, development and testing.
(4) Developmental and operational test and evaluation.
(5) Technical and management assessments (e.g., engineering, test, and
program management) to identify and mitigate risks and manage issues. 
(6) Development of training materials in support of the business system.
(7) Coordination and approval of memoranda of agreement, interface control
agreements and service level agreements. 
e. The combined schedule actions needed to deliver and support the capability.
f. A component-based representation of the decomposition of the work to be executed
to deliver and support the capability (e.g., work breakdown structure or capability 
roadmap). 
g. Acquisition objectives: a description of the organizational or strategic business goals
for the development and delivery of the business capability in terms of cost and benefits, 
schedule, return on investment, and affordability. These should include indicators to identify 
when a program may be at risk. 
h. Baseline: a reference against which to measure progress of the business capability.
The desired end state of the business system and associated business processes at the 
program or release level, expressed in terms of cost, schedule, performance, and other 
measures as appropriate. Baselines should be established no later than 24 months after the 
original Solution Analysis ATP. 
(1) If at the program level, the baseline will be set prior to the development of the
first release/deployment. 
(2) If at the release level, the baseline will be set prior to the development of each
release or deployment. 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
43 
i. Tailored business system acquisition strategy.
(1) Acquisition content: a description of the program approach to leverage
competition to acquire the required capability at reduced cost and risk. The approach must 
describe the business strategy, including major contracts planned, contract type(s) and 
incentives, market research, potential sources, capability support strategy, subcontracting 
opportunities, special contracting considerations and special clauses, the business case for or 
against obtaining warranties, payment methods, contract management and administration, 
intellectual property strategy, and use of COTS or reasons not to use COTS. 
(2) Technical management content: a description of the program approach to
leverage systems engineering, test and evaluation (T&E), cybersecurity, and data 
management processes to reduce technical risk.  Specific T&E management content 
requirements include: 
(a) Test events to collect data must be defined, scheduled, and resourced in
the capability implementation plan, including a Developmental Evaluation Framework 
matrix. 
(b) Cybersecurity T&E should be based on a zero-trust model and incorporate
automated testing practices as much as practical (e.g., static/dynamic code analysis) early in 
the lifecycle to remediate and mitigate vulnerabilities. It will include continuous monitoring 
and will consider appropriate application of the DoD Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation 
Guidebook for cybersecurity T&E activities. The MDA will not tailor cybersecurity T&E 
solely to meet authority to operate requirements. For business systems on the DOT&E 
oversight list, cybersecurity operational T&E must also include a Cyber Economic 
Vulnerability Analysis as outlined in current DOT&E Memoranda. 
(c) T&E planning will include mission-oriented development T&E with actual
operators performing end-to-end scenarios in a controlled environment, which may be 
conducted as integrated tests to also address operational test goals. 
(d) Interoperability developmental T&E will include testing with actual
representations of interface systems in a controlled environment. 
(e) Business systems on the DOT&E Oversight List will document T&E
management content in a test and evaluation master plan. 
(f) Automated test tools and scientific test and analysis techniques should be
considered to increase test efficiency. 
(g) (Added)(DAF) For business systems on the T&E Oversight List, a Concept
of Operations (CONOPS) is required. 
(3) Other content if needed: international considerations, multiyear procurement and
integration of intelligence assessments, and expected benefits for potential prototypes as well 
as the approach for making them operational. 
j. Capability Support Plan: a strategy for executing capability support activities and the
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
44 
leaders responsible for these activities. The plan will be developed in a transparent manner 
and will be made readily available for reviews as needed. 
(1) The capability support plan should include:
(a) A governance structure that provides resources, prioritizes changes, and
establishes plans for executing changes that fall within the scope of the original 
capability requirements. 
(b) A plan for conducting periodic program reviews, including the frequency,
content, and format of these reviews. 
(c) A threshold for changes to determine whether or not the change requires re-
entry into the BCAC process. Major capability changes that do not fall within the scope of the 
original capability requirements will require re-initiation of the BCAC process to integrate the 
new capability. 
(d) Tailored capability implementation plans for each new set of capability
requirements addressed in this phase. 
(2) The capability support plan will be continuously maintained throughout the
capability life cycle and will be reviewed and updated as appropriate to accommodate for 
capability modernization or new capability requirements. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) The capability support plan will address the process for
deficiency reporting and tracking.  For more information on deficiency 
reporting, refer to AFI 63-101/20-101 and DAFI 99-103.  
k. (Added)(DAF). The Capability Implementation Plan will include and describe all
non-material activities (but not limited to): business requirements, business process 
engineering (BPR) results, high level schedule and resource approach, high level 
roadmap, compliance requirements (laws, regulations, policies), acquisition plan, 
alignment with the BMA Enterprise Architecture, funding structure, proposed systems to 
sunset. (T-1) 
4B.3. PROGRESSION OF CAPABILITY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
CONTENT. 
a. During early BCAC phases, the capability implementation plan will contain a low level
of detail because knowledge is limited early in the life cycle. As the life cycle progresses, the 
amount of information and the level of detail will mature and evolve. Each program, in 
collaboration with the MDA, should assess the information requirements for each BCAC 
phase and determine which ones are applicable to manage the program and inform program 
decisions. Information requirements that support requirements validation and the CMO 
certification process must be completed. 
b. Table 6 describes the expected progress of capability implementation plan content

APPENDIX 4D: BUSINESS SYSTEM SOLUTION DOCUMENTATION 
4D.1.  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. 
a. Functional requirements will be linked to inputs and outputs that define how
the functional requirements support the business processes. 
b. Functional requirements will be linked to technical and lifecycle support requirements
that constrain how the functional requirements support the business process. 
4D.2.  POTENTIAL BUSINESS SYSTEM SOLUTION SELECTION. 
a. The program manager, with support from the functional lead and the appropriate
cost agency, establishes criteria for evaluating potential business system solutions. 
b. Evaluation criteria must include:

APPENDIX 4E: (Added)(DAF) BCAC PHASES DETAILED PROCESSES 
4E.1.  (Added)(DAF) Background:  BCAC Phases Detailed Processes. 
a. (Added)(DAF) Overview.  Execution of the business system process consists of
five phases; capability initiatives enter into the Capability Need Identification phase, but 
may transition to other phases if the intent and criteria for current phase, and readiness 
for the next phase, is met to the satisfaction of the ATP approval authority. 
(1) (Added)(DAF) Phases are not meant to be linear, the process is iterative and
activities for one phase may be initiated or completed in another phase. 
(2) (Added)(DAF) Decisions are data driven, not documentation based and are
tailorable based on the individual capability effort. Decisions will be presented to the 
functional portfolio board and documented in an ATP memorandum. 
(3) (Added)(DAF) ATP decisions, including but not limited to tailoring
considerations, compliance requirements, and other agreements, will be captured in a 
decision memorandum.  Table 5 provides considerations for decision criteria for ATPs 1-6. 
b. (Added)(AF) The DAF further identifies four categories (“Types”) of business
capability requests that can enter the BCAC based on capability solution availability. Each 
type follows a tailored path through the phases.  Note: Implementation may be limited by 
capability of the BMA Service Catalog; contact SAF/MGB for information on BMA 
Service Catalog availability and accessibility.   
(1) (Added)(DAF) BCAC Capability Request Type 0 (“Use it Now”) are
requests for specifically designated COTs/GOTs/legacy custom developed applications or 
SaaS/aPaaS solutions which meet the unit’s need without modification or code change, are 
affordable within local (up to MAJCOM or FLDCOM) budget constraints, and can be 
installed using only local resources.  
(2) (Added)(DAF) BCAC Capability Request Type 1 are requests to begin using
a solution from the BMA Service Catalog (application, SaaS, aPaaS) that does not meet the 
Use it Now criteria and does not require a functionality change or data migration.   
(3) (Added)(DAF) BCAC Capability Request Type 2 are requests to begin using
a solution from the BMA Service Catalog (application, SaaS, aPaaS) that does not meet the 
Use it Now criteria and does not require a functionality change or data migration.  Type 2 
is broken into migration to a solution the requestor is not currently using (2m) or 
enhancing a solution the requestor is already using (2e). 
(4) (Added)(DAF) BCAC Capability Request Type 3 is a request for a new
custom-developed capability (3c), product (3p), or SaaS/aPaaS (3s), solution, not already in 
the BMA Service Catalog, regardless of customization or modifications necessary to 
implement. 
DoDI5000.75_DAFI63-144  26 JANUARY 2023 
52 
4E.2. (Added)(DAF) Phase 1: Capability Need Identification. 
(a) (Added)(DAF) This Phase begins when the Functional Sponsor assigns resources
and directs the execution of the process and ends with an ATP decision that the capability 
requirements are adequately defined there is an executable workplan to proceed.  
(b) (Added)(DAF) The functional sponsor leads this phase with guidance and
support from the Deputy Chief Management Officer. The objective is to establish a clear 
understanding of needed business capabilities so that the functional sponsor and Milestone 
Decision Authority can decide to invest time and resources into investigating business 
solutions.

G.2. DEFINITIONS.
These terms and their definitions are for the purpose of this issuance. 
TERM
DEFINITION
baseline 
A reference against which to measure progress of the business 
capability. Will be included in the capability implementation plan 
and will be used to measure cost, schedule and performance (in 
addition to other desired measures). Measurement will begin during 
the acquisition, testing, and deployment phase and continue through 
capability support. The baseline can be measured at the program 
level or release level to support agile implementation, i.e., a program 
can carry multiple baselines. 
business capability 
A business capability is the core ability the organization needs to 
deliver requisite products and services and provide value. An 
example of a business capability is “just in time” inventory 
management. This capability is different from other types of 
inventory management in that it optimizes resources to minimize 
shelf time in specific locations of the supply chain. 
(Added)(DAF) 
Business Capability

COTs/GOTs/legacy custom developed applications or 
SaaS/aPaaS solutions which meet the unit’s need without 
modification or code change, are affordable within local (up 
to MAJCOM) budget constraints, and can be installed using 
only local resources. 
(Added)(DAF) 
BCAC Capability 
Request Type 1 
A BMA Catalog request to begin using a solution from the BMA 
Service Catalog (application, SaaS, aPaaS) that does not meet 
the Use it Now criteria and does not require a functionality 
change or data migration.

Business Mission 
Area (BMA) 
The BMA ensures that the right capabilities, resources, and 
materiel are reliably delivered to our warfighters:  what they 
need, where they need it, when they need it, anywhere in the 
world.  In order to cost-effectively meet these requirements, the 
DoD current business and financial management 
infrastructure—processes, systems, and data standards—are 
being transformed to ensure better support to the warfighter and 
improve accountability to the taxpayer. (ref. DoDI 8115.02 E2.1.) 
(Added)(DAF)    
BMA Service Catalog 
(BMA-SC) 
The BMA Service Catalog (in development) will be the one-stop-
shop location for business IT. The BMA-SC will be a common-
access IT service designed to deliver BMA Enterprise solutions 
to Airmen and Guardians, to capture business needs and 
requests for business solutions, and to receive proposed solutions 
from Airmen and Guardians for potential inclusion in the BMA-
SC. Available at URL:  
(Added)(DAF)    
BMA Strategy 
The BMA Strategy a product produced and published by 
SAF/MG with annual updates. It provides DAF stakeholders a 
clear picture and path forward for aligning the BMA with 
Congressional, DoD and DAF direction.
