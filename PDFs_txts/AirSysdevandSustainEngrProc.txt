This Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) complements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1/20-1, 
Integrated Life Cycle Management and Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 63-
101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management.  This AFPAM provides non-directive processes 
and procedures that complement the mandatory policies for implementing Air System 
Development and Sustainment Engineering Processes and Procedures under DAFI 63-101/20-101.  
This publication applies to all civilian employees and uniformed members of the Regular Air 
Force, the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard, and those who are contractually obligated 
to comply with Department of the Air Force publications. This AFPAM also supports Department 
of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition System and DoD Instruction 
(DoDI) 5000.02, Operation of the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (collectively called the DoD 
5000 acquisition series).  Additional non-mandatory guidance on best practices, lessons learned, 
and expectations are available in the Guidebooks for each functional area of acquisitions, all of 
which can be found at https://aaf.dau.edu/guidebooks/. Mission, safety, performance, and 
sustainability remain the standards of excellence for aircraft. Safety and the ability to perform its 
mission are important priorities for an aircraft throughout its lifecycle. This requires modifications 
to an aircraft to extend its service life and its ability to perform its mission safely. The guidance in 
this document supports this process to ensure that all personnel working to support an aircraft have 
current and accurate procedures regardless of where the aircraft is operating. This AFPAM 
provides recommended processes, procedures, and best practices for four lines of effort that are 
essential to Air Force aircraft development and sustaining engineering. To ensure standardization, 
any organization supplementing this publication will send the implementing publication to 
SAF/AQR for review and coordination before publishing. In accordance with DAFI 63-101/20-
101, this publication applies to all military and civilian AF personnel, including Air Force Reserve

Chapter 1 
SEEK EAGLE 
1.1.  SEEK EAGLE Program Overview. 
1.1.1.  SEEK EAGLE is the Air Force aircraft-store certification process for determining safe 
and acceptable carriage and release (employment and jettison), safe escape, and ballistics 
accuracy (when applicable) for all stores (weapons, pods, tanks, etc.) in specific loading 
configuration on Air Force test and combat coded aircraft. 
1.1.2.  SEEK EAGLE is used (as required) in support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and 
Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) aircraft-store certification for use on foreign-owned or leased 
U.S.-origin aircraft. In accordance with DAFI 63-101/20-101, use of the process applies to all 
U.S. Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command operational 
units; and to aircraft acquired as FMS or DCS cases when customers request SEEK EAGLE 
support from the USAF in the SEEK EAGLE certification process. 
1.2.  Applicability. 
1.2.1.  The SEEK EAGLE process assures aircraft-store compatibility in store loading and 
unloading, carriage, release, and ballistic weapon delivery accuracy verification. 
1.2.2.  By incorporating appropriate engineering analyses, computer modeling and 
simulations, ground testing and flight-testing to obtain the data needed to verify accuracy of 
and/or update of Operational Flight Programs and Technical Orders, the SEEK EAGLE 
process assures aircraft-store compatibility. 
1.3.  Recommended Roles and Responsibilities.

1.4.  SEEK EAGLE Processes and Procedures. 
1.4.1.  Process overview. This section provides guidance and procedures on how Program 
Managers, Major Command, and other Air Force customers obtain support from the AFSEO. 
1.4.2.  Types of SERs. 
1.4.2.1.  Quick Reaction Capability. Requires the completion of all aircraft-store 
compatibility activities necessary to certify the requested aircraft-store configuration. This 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
11 
is an accelerated certification and includes ballistics accuracy verification, if required. 
When an urgent operational need date for combat capability exists and the normal SEEK 
EAGLE Certification process will not meet the user need date, the SER will be issued or 
amended as a Quick Reaction Capability SER. 
1.4.2.2.  Flight Clearance Recommendation. A flight clearance recommendation for 
developmental or operational flight-testing of specific aircraft-store configurations with 
supporting engineering rationale from all SEEK EAGLE engineering disciplines is needed. 
The Flight Clearance Recommendation identifies, as appropriate, the aircraft loading 
configuration, carriage, jettison and employment limitations, information needed to make 
drag and stability computations, cartridge and orifice combinations or settings, reference 
to loading procedures and delivery information, store mass and physical properties, and 
any other information that affects personnel or flight safety and mission capability. 
1.4.2.3.  Limited Flight Clearance Recommendation. Recommends the developmental or 
operational flight-testing of specific aircraft-store configurations with supporting 
engineering rationale from a subset of the required SEEK EAGLE engineering disciplines. 
If the AFSEO provides a Limited Flight Clearance Recommendation, the aircraft Program 
Manager addresses the remaining engineering disciplines to support the flight clearance. 
1.4.2.4.  Certification Recommendation. Requires the completion of all activities required 
to certify the aircraft- store configurations requested in the SER. These activities include 
planning; analysis; tests; documentation; development; publication and fielding of 
pertinent technical manuals applicable to loading, carriage, and employment, which 
include the verified ballistics data in the -34 and -25 Technical Orders; and the 
incorporation of the appropriate software changes, resulting from ballistics accuracy 
verification of the Operational Flight Program. 
1.4.2.5.  Limited Certification Recommendation.  Recommends fielding of aircraft-store 
configuration(s) with supporting engineering rationale from a subset of the required SEEK 
EAGLE engineering disciplines. A capability provided to the warfighter while a routine 
certification and ballistics accuracy verification tasks are being accomplished. Publication 
of technical data is required. 
1.4.2.6.  Compatibility Assessment. An engineering product that recommends aircraft-
store configurations with supporting engineering rationale to satisfy SERs from SAF/IA 
for FMS, U.S. industry customer for Direct Commercial Sale, and foreign owned or leased 
US-origin aircraft customers. The assessment documents and provides customers with 
results of any analyses and/or tests performed by the compatibility agency in support of the 
customer’s requirements, but does not formally recommend a certification or flight 
clearance to the aircraft Program Manager. The compatibility assessment may address all 
engineering disciplines, or it may only address a subset of disciplines. 
1.4.2.7.  Modification Assessment. A SEEK EAGLE product that formally documents a 
determination that a proposed incremental modification to the aircraft and/or store does not 
diminish established aircraft-store compatibility capability and do not require 
recertification (or revised Flight Clearance Recommendation). Engineering rationale 
supporting the modification assessment is captured to support future determinations and/or 
follow-on products that may be required.

Chapter 2 
RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, PROCEDURES, AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE 
FOR COMMUNICATIONS, NAVIGATION, SURVEILLANCE/AIR TRAFFIC 
MANAGEMENT (CNS/ATM), NAVIGATION SAFETY, AND NEXT GENERATION 
AIR TRANSPORTATION 
2.1.  Overview. 
2.1.1.  CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety compliance in civil airspace is a continuous process 
as sovereign nations implement new technologies, capabilities, policies, and processes to 
maximize the efficiency of their airspace. Airspace access is moving away from strict mandates 
towards a concept of “best-equipped, best-served.” Therefore, securing the proper CNS/ATM 
capabilities enables operations in civil airspace (driven by statute and international aviation 
regulations). 
2.1.2.  In addition, CNS/ATM assessments are required for all Air Force airworthiness 
approval certifications for systems acquiring, integrating, or modifying a CNS/ATM 
capability. The CNS/ATM Center of Excellence (COE) serves the AF as the central knowledge 
source of civil airspace access requirements, recommended equipage strategies, and a source 
of subject matter expertise to assist AF manned and unmanned aircraft Program Offices with 
a subset of their airworthiness certification activities. Finally, as advanced navigation 
capabilities are implemented on the aircraft, the CNS/ATM COE conducts a required 
navigation data certification process. 
2.2.  Applicability. 
2.2.1.  This chapter provides additional guidance for Communications, Navigation Safety, and 
Next Generation Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Transportation System Performance 
(TSP) directive requirements for air system Program Managers in DAFI 63-101/20-101, 
paragraph 5.4.. 
2.2.2.  This chapter also provides CNS/ATM implementation resources, to include additional 
explanatory background on the CNS/ATM processes, technical assistance available from the 
Air Force CNS/ATM Center of Excellence (COE), typical Air Force-wide roles and 
responsibilities for coordinating CNS/ATM compliance, and procedures on reporting issues 
affecting CNS/ATM capabilities. 
2.3.  Background. 
2.3.1.  The 1944 Chicago Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization 
reaffirmed nations’ exclusive sovereignty over airspace above their territory and the nation’s 
authority to dictate terms of access. AF policy emphasizes conformance to national and 
international standards for safe access to global airspace. 
2.3.2.  Conformance with CNS/ATM capability standards is not to be interpreted as ceding 
jurisdiction or regulatory authority to civil or foreign regulators. Aircraft not meeting 
CNS/ATM capability standards may be subjected to ground delays waiting for clearance, 
directed to operate on less optimum routes, or denied airspace access. 
16 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
2.4.  Intent. 
2.4.1.  This chapter addresses recommended roles, responsibilities, and processes regarding all 
acquisition, integration, and modification of CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety capabilities. 
The intent is not to define the CNS/ATM compliance assessment and airworthiness approval 
process; USAF Airworthiness Bulletin (AWB-325) provides instructions for the assessment 
and approval/certification of CNS/ATM functionality of AF air systems. 
2.4.2.  This chapter does not provide authority to deviate from the guidance in AFPD 62-6 or 
DAFI 62-601, USAF Airworthiness. 
2.5.  Navigation Safety. 
2.5.1.  This chapter supports the AF objective to enhance navigation and safety capabilities. 
Navigation safety describes a family of technologies that promote aviation safety, increase 
aircrew situational awareness, increase survivability, improve navigational performance, or 
gather information needed to evaluate an incident. 
2.5.2.  The term “CNS/ATM,” as used in this chapter, includes navigation safety equipment 
for AF aircraft. 
2.6.  Defining CNS/ATM. 
2.6.1.  CNS/ATM is an all-encompassing term for a set of capabilities to support the 
interactions between the aircrew and air traffic control. While primarily used in civil airspace, 
some capabilities may also be employed in AF and Department of Defense (DoD) controlled 
airspace. 
2.6.2.  In addition to integration and implementation of these capabilities, there are capabilities 
that require life-cycle management, ensuring their compliance. 
2.7.  CNS/ATM Recommended Processes, Resources and Office Procedures. 
2.7.1.  Publication of a CNS/ATM Capability Standard to Distribution of Operational 
Approval. 
2.7.1.1.  This end-to-end process starts with the publication or revision of a CNS/ATM 
capability standard and produces an operational approval resulting in airspace access for 
the aircraft (Figure 2.1.). This process is used with all aircraft acquiring, integrating, or 
modifying CNS/ATM capabilities according to the roles and responsibilities defined in 
DAFI 63-101/20-101, DoDI 5000.80_DAFI 63-146 (for Middle Tier of Acquisition 
programs), and/or DoDI 5000.81_DAFI 63-147 (for Urgent Capability Acquisition 
programs). The aircraft PM determines when these processes and procedures apply to 
Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) maintaining Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) type 
certification. 
2.7.1.2.  CNS/ATM capability standards are created by national/international civil aviation 
authorities and recognized standards development organizations. All stakeholders who 
monitor CNS/ATM capability standards and/or interface with host nation civil aviation 
authorities, foreign defense ministries, and Air Navigation Service Providers report 
proposed, pending, or published changes, policy changes, or other CNS/ATM issues to 
AF/A3O and the CNS/ATM COE upon discovery.

Figure 2.1.  CNS/ATM Capability Standard to Operational Approval Process. 
 
2.7.2.  Generic Performance Matrix. The CNS/ATM COE monitors CNS/ATM capability 
standards and converts these standards into a set of generic performance requirements 
documented in a Generic Performance Matrix. A Generic Performance Matrix does not define 
performance requirements for specific aircraft. Generic Performance Matrices provide 
examples of successful CNS/ATM capability standards verification methodologies. A Generic 
Performance Matrix, created and maintained by the CNS/ATM COE, is prepared for each 
CNS/ATM capability. The CNS/ATM COE notifies MAJCOMs, PMs, and the Technical 
Airworthiness Authority (TAA) of an applicable new and/or updated CNS/ATM capability 
standard published by a civil authority and/or the publication of a new Generic Performance 
Matrix. The Generic Performance Matrix forms the basis for a Tailored Performance Matrix 
(TPM). 
2.7.2.1.  MAJCOMs determine, with PM support, how to address CNS/ATM capability 
standards for aircraft (materiel or non-materiel solution). 
2.7.2.2.  CNS/ATM materiel solutions will be accomplished per DAFI 63-101/20-101. 
2.7.2.3.  It is advised that AFLCMC/EZA, Avionics Division-Engineering Directorate, 
and/or the CNS/ATM COE participate in major design reviews. CNS/ATM COE subject 
matter expertise may be leveraged by the Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) to 
ensure airworthiness criteria have been satisfied. 
2.7.3.  CNS/ATM Technical Support Available to Aircraft PMs/Chief Engineer (CEs). In 
support of CNS/ATM capability airworthiness certification as defined in DAFI 62-601 and 
18 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
augmented by AWB-325, Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management 
(CNS/ATM) Compliance Assessment Process, it is highly encouraged that PMs acquiring, 
integrating, or modifying CNS/ATM capabilities contact AFLCMC/EZA, Avionics Division 
Engineering Directorate, and/or the CNS/ATM COE to seek technical guidance. 
AFLCMC/EZA and/or CNS/ATM COE can assist program management offices with 
CNS/ATM matrix tailoring, aid in the understanding of compliance requirements, and advise 
on potential compliance verification methodologies. CNS/ATM COE engineering resources 
are available to participate in major design reviews in order to ensure CNS/ATM capability at 
the end of development meets performance requirements and reduces overall program risk. 
2.7.4.  Performance Assessment (PA). A Performance Assessment validates how each 
performance requirement within the TPM was addressed in a new or modified aircraft 
configuration. Performance Assessment results are documented in a Performance Assessment 
Report, and include CNS/ATM functionality added to an aircraft, and the degree to which the 
integrated systems perform with respect to applicable CNS/ATM performance requirements. 
2.7.4.1.  Performance Assessment Report. A Performance Assessment Report documents 
the outcomes/findings of a Performance Assessment and is one way of showing CNS/ATM 
capability compliance. 
2.7.4.2.  The Performance Assessment Report can be submitted as an airworthiness 
Compliance Report (CR) artifact as described in DAFI 62-601 and AWB-325. 
2.7.5.  Airworthiness Flight Authorization. PMs obtain an Airworthiness Flight Authorization 
that approves the acquired, integrated, or modified CNS/ATM capabilities. This authorization 
is acquired either from the designated Technical Airworthiness Authority or the Delegated 
Technical Authority as determined in accordance with DAFI 62-601. 
2.7.6.  Operational Approval. After obtaining an Airworthiness Flight Authorization, the 
MAJCOM approves operational use of CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety systems in 
accordance with any flight authorization limitation and with AFMAN 11-202V3, General 
Flight Rules. The MAJCOM provides a copy of the signed CNS/ATM operational approval to 
AF/A3O, Air Force Flight Standards Agency, the appropriate PM, and CNS/ATM COE. Air 
Force Flight Standards Agency serves as the repository for AF operational approvals. 
2.7.7.  CNS/ATM Equipment Contract Strategy. The CNS/ATM COE currently maintains 
multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for CNS/ATM hardware 
and software procurement. 
2.7.7.1.  Where possible, the CNS/ATM COE negotiates extended warranty clauses not 
usually available through commercial means. 
2.7.7.2.  Contact the CNS/ATM COE for more information regarding CNS/ATM hardware 
and software procurement through the internet Global Air Traffic Management (iGATM) 
catalog. 
2.7.8.  The PM typically determines whether available products are financially advantageous 
or technically suitable. 
2.8.  Analyzing Existing Systems for CNS/ATM Capability. 
2.8.1.  Performance Assessment Report. A Performance Assessment Report documents the 
outcomes/findings of a Performance Assessment and is one way of showing CNS/ATM 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
19 
capability compliance. The Performance Assessment Report can be submitted as an 
airworthiness Compliance Report artifact as described in DAFI 62-601 and AWB-325. 
2.8.2.  A Performance Assessment can also be accomplished to determine CNS/ATM 
functionality provided by an existing aircraft configuration or as a gap analysis prior to a 
materiel/non-materiel solution determination. If the gap analysis is a Program Office 
engineering activity, then adherence to AWB-325 is not necessary. However, some of the 
processes described in AWB-325 could be leveraged by the Program Office to support the gap 
assessment. 
2.8.3.  Airworthiness Flight Authorization. PMs receive an Airworthiness Flight Authorization 
that approves the acquired, integrated, or modified CNS/ATM capabilities. The Authorization 
is acquired from the designated Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) as determined in 
accordance with DAFI 62-601. 
2.9.  Discovery of an Issue Impacting CNS/ATM Capability. 
2.9.1.  Paragraph 2.7 and Figure 2.1 describe the typical acquisition process regarding a new 
or modified CNS/ATM capability. This section provides recommended processes for 
CNS/ATM capability issues that may arise during the aircraft or capability’s life cycle. 
2.9.1.1.  CNS/ATM capabilities typically require life-cycle management. 
2.9.1.2.  There are several CNS/ATM capability monitoring programs that are managed by 
civil aviation authorities. These issues may include, but are not limited to, Reduced Vertical 
Separation Minimum (RVSM) requalifications, Mode-Select (Mode-S) performance 
compliance and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and data 
communication issues. 
2.9.2.  The CNS/ATM COE notifies the cognizant PM upon discovery of an issue impacting 
previously certified CNS/ATM capability. 
2.9.2.1.  In turn, the PM notifies the affected MAJCOMs and Technical Airworthiness 
Authority or Delegated Technical Authority upon notice of an issue affecting CNS/ATM 
capability. 
2.9.2.2.  Stakeholders communicate and collaborate to determine the impact of the 
CNS/ATM related issue and take actions to mitigate degraded CNS/ATM capabilities. 
2.9.3.  If the issue is identified by the aircraft program management office, the PM notifies the 
CNS/ATM COE, MAJCOM, and Technical Airworthiness Authority or Delegated Technical 
Authority upon discovery of issue discovery. The stakeholders then communicate and 
collaborate to determine the impact of the CNS/ATM related issue and take actions to mitigate 
degraded CNS/ATM capabilities. 
2.9.4.  The Technical Airworthiness Authority or Delegated Technical Authority amends the 
airworthiness approval and may solicit assistance from the CNS/ATM COE or 
AFLCMC/EZA. 
2.9.5.  The PM provides the amended airworthiness flight authorization to the using MAJCOM 
to facilitate operational approval IAW AFMAN 11-202V3.

AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
2.10.  Supporting Different Types of Data Chain Letter of Acceptance. 
2.10.1.  Navigation Database Certification. A Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics 
(RTCA) Document (DO)-200B, Standard for Processing Aeronautical Data, certified 
navigation data chain is required in order to meet Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or 
area navigation (RNAV) airspace requirements, with the exception of RNP-10 and basic area 
navigation (BRNAV) airspace. The purpose of this certification is to verify that the procedures 
used to process data from its state-supplied source file, through the various intermediate 
processing steps and into the active flight plan does not induce any errors. Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) guidance concerning navigation data chain certification has been 
harmonized with International Civil Aviation Organization guidance so that it is a universal 
requirement for RNAV and/or RNP operations worldwide. The navigation database 
certification encompasses the following areas: 
2.10.1.1.  Type 1 Data Chain of Acceptance (LOA). The Type 1 LOA covers the portion 
of the data chain from an originating Aeronautical Information Provider to the electronic 
database that is created by the Type 1 LOA holder. This database is then used by the Type 
2 LOA holder to create a version of the database that can be loaded into the aircraft. The 
primary navigational data supplier for the DoD is the National Geospatial Intelligence 
Agency (NGA). Through a Memorandum of Understanding with the FAA, the FAA grants 
a Type 1 LOA to NGA and the CNS/ATM COE audits NGA to ensure continued 
compliance with the terms of the FAA’s LOA. The CNS/ATM COE audits and writes Type 
1 LOA to other entities providing navigational data to the Air Force (and other DoD 
offices). 
2.10.1.2.  Certification for the aircraft specific procedures used to transfer the NGA 
provided data onto the aircraft data loader cartridge to include a certification of the 
aircraft/weapons/electronics (A/W/E) that transfers NGA provided data onto a data loader 
cartridge so that it can be taken to the aircraft. (Type 2 Certification) 
2.10.1.3.  Type 2 Data Chain LOA, A Type 2 LOA is a required airworthiness artifact for 
navigation accuracy of Area Navigation Required/Required Navigation Performance 
(RNAV/RNP) of 4 nautical miles or tighter. The CNS/ATM COE audits the entity 
responsible for converting the Type 1 LOA approved database into a form that can be 
loaded into the aircraft avionics. The CNS/ATM COE audits the Type 2 LOA holder to 
ensure the database is compatible with the aircraft systems to ensure performance 
requirements are met and the CNS/ATM capability standard is satisfied. The CNS/ATM 
COE is also responsible for auditing and writing Type 2 LOA approvals for Air Force 
aircraft using commercial databases. 
2.10.1.4.  Certification that on aircraft storage and utilization of the navigation database is 
consistent with the aircraft’s mission requirements, and meets RTCA DO-200B 
requirements. 
2.10.2.  The CNS/ATM COE is responsible for certifying the navigation data chain process. In 
accordance with DAFI 63-101/20-101, when the CNS/ATM capability standard requires a 
navigation accuracy of Area Navigation/Required Navigation Performance (RNAV/RNP) of 
4 nautical miles or less, the CNS/ATM COE audits the responsible entity for converting and 
distributing the Type 1 Letter of Acceptance approved electronic database. The approved 
electronic database is converted to an aircraft-specific electronic database, which is compatible 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
21 
with the aircraft system to ensure performance requirements are met and the CNS/ATM 
capability standard is satisfied.  The COE audits and writes Type 2 Letter of Acceptance 
approvals for Air Force aircraft using commercial databases. 
2.10.3.  Navigation Database Conversion (NavDB) Tool Certification. As part of the Type 2 
LOA, the CNS/ATM COE certifies the MAJCOM-approved NavDB conversion tools used to 
convert the Type 1 LOA approved electronic database into an image that is compatible with 
the aircraft navigation system. The NavDB conversion tool will conform to applicable 
CNS/ATM capability standards. The certification is done through an audit of the tool and its 
development processes, which results in a Type 2 Aeronautical Tool Letter of Certification. 
2.11.  Typical CNS/ATM Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities. 
2.11.1.  The following roles and responsibilities are provided as background to better 
understand the CNS/ATM process. Reference DAFI 63-101/20-101 for the directive

Chapter 3 
RECORDED AIRCRAFT INFORMATION 
3.1.  Overview. 
3.1.1.  Recorded Aircraft Information supports mishap investigations, flight data analysis and 
trending programs, aircraft development programs and operational processes. A systematic 
approach to integrating all data collection requirements is essential to ensure capture of critical 
information and optimization of benefit while minimizing overall cost. The primary goal is to 
balance information needs with program resources and operational considerations. The 
minimum attributes of crash survivable flight data recorders for AF aircraft are listed in 
Attachment 4 of this Pamphlet along with a standardized list of optional enhanced flight data 
requirements. This chapter provides recommended guidance for integrating those data 
capabilities with other aircraft data requirements. 
3.2.  Applicability. 
3.2.1.  DAFI 63-101/20-101, Chapter 5, requires all Air Force aircraft systems (manned 
aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) classified as Group 3 or higher in accordance with 
DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigations, Reporting, and Record Keeping) to record 
crash survivable parametric and acoustic data that meets minimum mandatory requirements to 
support mishap investigation. Guidance in this AFPAM implements DAFI 63-101/20-101 
requirements that the PM collaborate with data user stakeholders to conduct a systematic 
assessment of information needs (including mishap investigation, integrity programs, 
maintenance and operational analyses) that applies to all air systems: owned, operated, used, 
designed, or modified by the AF. 
3.3.  Goals. 
3.3.1.  Improve quality of mishap investigation and reporting. 
3.3.1.1.  The Air Force is required to investigate; record; and report aviation mishaps in 
accordance with DAFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and DAFMAN 91-223, 
Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports. The Air Force forms boards to investigate and 
determine the cause(s) of mishaps. While many mishap investigations are straightforward 
and benefit from surviving crew testimony, the majority require extensive analysis, test 
and simulation. With modern aircraft employing electronic control systems and video 
displays, some physical evidence may no longer exist at the mishap scene. Technological 
advances in flight data recorder (FDR) capabilities will be exploited to facilitate mishap 
investigations involving these aircraft. 
3.3.1.2.  Investigations involving aircraft with crash survivable data recorders have 
provided more conclusive results than those without recorders. This data allows the board 
to spend less time determining what occurred and more time determining why a mishap 
occurred and formulating recommendations. Recorded aircraft information is essential for 
modern mishap investigations, particularly those involving fly-by-wire or glass cockpit 
aircraft. 
3.3.2.  Enable data analysis programs. 
26 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
3.3.2.1.  Established data analysis and trending programs such as those prescribed by the 
Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and the Propulsion Systems Integrity Program have 
proven their worth through trend identification and cost savings. Additional programs such 
as Vibration Monitoring System (VMS), Mechanical Equipment and Subsystems Integrity 
Program (MECSIP), Avionics Integrity Program (AVIP), military Flight Operations 
Quality Assurance (mFOQA), Reliability-Centered Maintenance, Condition-Based 
Maintenance (CBM), Joint Advanced Health, and Usage Monitoring System encourage 
near real-time analysis of recorded data. To maximize use of these programs, it is 
imperative for the Air Force to improve aircraft data availability to all information 
stakeholders. 
3.3.2.2.  Recorded flight data can be analyzed and trended for use in both proactive and 
reactive operational and maintenance functions. The utility of predicting component 
wearout or imminent failure results in extensive cost savings. The ability to remove or 
repair equipment on an as-needed basis versus scheduled intervals saves costs and 
circumvents component failures leading to mishaps. The civil aviation industry pioneered 
the use of recorded aircraft information in a proactive mode, examining non-mishap flight 
data to identify hazardous procedures and environments. Recording non-safety information 
(such as takeoff gross weight, center of gravity, fuel loads, etc.) can also assist in 
determining operational efficiencies. 
3.3.3.  Ensure an integrated solution. 
3.3.3.1.  There are many sources of information on an aircraft. Modern aircraft systems 
have digital data buses with volumes of parametric data readily available for recording. 
Cockpit voice recorders (CVR) capture valuable acoustic information on many aircraft. 
Training needs often result in heads-up-display (HUD) and multi-function display (MFD) 
video recorders. 
3.3.3.2.  Future weapon systems may have separate acoustic, video, parametric and 
datalink information sources, or achieve optimization through integration of the 
technologies. Analyzing the total system requirements provides the best and lowest cost 
solution to the program. 
3.3.4.  Enhance training effectiveness. 
3.3.4.1.  Videotapes of HUD and MFD images are currently used in crew training. The 
tapes occasionally survive crash dynamics and contribute to mishap investigations. 
Emerging recording system technologies are capable of integrating acoustic, image and 
parametric information into crash survivable packages. 
3.3.4.2.  Integration of these information sources coupled with real time simulators 
provides higher fidelity training opportunities. 
3.3.5.  Assist new aircraft development programs. 
3.3.5.1.  Identification of information customers occurs prior to the EMD phase of a Major 
Capability Acquisition program (or equivalent phase in other AAF program pathways). 
Early identification results in the most cost-effective and integrated solution for the 
program. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
27 
3.3.5.2.  Establishing a Recorded Aircraft Information Integrated Product Team (IPT) 
(previously called an Aircraft Information Working Group (AIWG)) prior to the EMD 
phase of development assists in specifying information recording requirements. 
3.4.  Recommended Roles and Responsibilities.

collection systems are employed. If program is past the EMD phase, assessment is 
conducted within 12 months of issuance of this publication. 
3.4.4.2.  Ensure representatives from all information user stakeholders (operations, 
maintenance, acquisition, safety, test & evaluation, and logistics communities) are included 
in conducting the systematic assessment of information needs. 
3.4.4.3.  Each aircraft program PM establishes a Recorded Aircraft Information IPT. 
3.4.4.4.  Provide integrated system solutions that support customer-defined capability

to record hundreds of parameters for many hours. Modern military aircraft demonstrate this 
ability by recording a plethora of information. Consequently, one of the challenges now 
becomes assuring critical parameters are captured in crash survivable media and not 
overlooked while identifying parameters used for other purposes. 
3.5.2.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the European Organization for Civil 
Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) and the U.S. military services have periodically 
recommended specific parameters for mishap investigation. Many of these parameters are 
required to be recorded, as a minimum allowable, set by various worldwide regulatory agencies 
such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Joint Aviation Authority (JAA). 
3.5.3.  Performance and functional requirements for information recording systems are 
determined by exhaustive review of current industry standards and mishap lessons learned. 
FAA Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) such as C124c and C123c, and Federal Aviation 
Regulation (FAR) 121.344 Appendix M, is consulted. International standardization efforts by 
EUROCAE Working Group 50 (WG 50) and the International Civil Aviation Organization 
will be reviewed along with recommendations of the NTSB and US Air Force Safety Center. 
Air Force Safety Center/SEF can provide the latest standards and USAF positions relative to 
these standards. 
3.6.  Recorded Aircraft Information Recommended Best Practices.

3.6.1.1.  The PM will ensure that decisions affecting aircraft system capabilities account 
for information needs of the operational, maintenance, acquisition, logistics and safety 
communities. 
3.6.1.2.  This is accomplished through a systematic assessment of the needs of all data users 
(to include mishap investigation, integrity programs, maintenance & operational analyses) 
for each aircraft program. 
3.6.2.  Establishing a Recorded Aircraft Information IPT. 
3.6.2.1.  The PM establishes a Recorded Aircraft Information IPT for each aircraft program 
to accomplish the systematic assessment of all information user needs and determine the 
most cost effective means to achieve the required recording capability. The Recorded 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
31 
Aircraft Information IPT will meet as necessary to address compliance issues and 
capabilities as weapon system technology changes. 
3.6.2.2.  Recorded Aircraft Information IPT Objectives. 
3.6.2.2.1.  Provide the PM with technical guidance and a current operational 
perspective to evaluate the proposed aircraft information collection and management

representative will chair the Recorded Aircraft Information IPT. The Recorded Aircraft 
Information IPT chairperson solicits appropriate members and advisors who are 
empowered to represent their organizations and are sufficiently trained and experienced in 
the subject matter. The Recorded Aircraft Information IPT members are responsible for 
developing cohesive and integrated information management recommendations, taking 
into consideration the operational usage, information security, maintenance and system 
integrity concept of the aircraft system. The Recorded Aircraft Information IPT will be 
composed of the following members: 
3.6.2.3.1.  The Recorded Aircraft Information IPT chairperson (i.e., PM or their 
designated representative). 
3.6.2.3.2.  The Program Office Chief Engineer or designated representative. 
3.6.2.3.3.  Experienced subject matter experts from the system requirements, 
operations, maintenance, logistics, and safety offices of the Lead Command; and from 
the Using Commands when deemed necessary by the PM to provide mishap 
investigation and mFOQA analysis requirements, where available.

32 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
advisors. Representatives from AFMC, test centers, legal offices and other agencies 
such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may be selected as advisors 
as needed. AFLCMC/HNC can provide Subject Matter Expertise on Encryption Issues, 
including Classified Data at Rest (CDAR). 
3.6.2.3.8.  Other members as deemed necessary by the Recorded Aircraft Information 
IPT chairperson, including members of other services for joint acquisition programs. 
3.6.2.4.  Recorded Aircraft Information IPT Responsibilities. The Recorded Aircraft 
Information IPT offers a unified government position to the PM. The Recorded Aircraft 
Information IPT completes the following actions to ensure the capture of critical 
information and optimization of benefit while minimizing cost: 
3.6.2.4.1.  Identify and evaluate all investigative, safety, logistical, operational, 
maintenance and training information needs associated with the aircraft, to include the 
collection, processing, storage, distribution and reporting of such information, and 
ensure information interoperability with current USAF Information Technology (IT) 
systems. 
3.6.2.4.2.  Assess existing and planned recording systems’ capabilities compared to the 
above information needs and determine necessary information recording system 
improvements in consideration of mishap investigation needs and the operational 
usage, maintenance and system integrity concept of the weapon system. 
3.6.2.4.3.  Determine the level of compliance with Recorded Aircraft Information 
requirements listed in Attachment 4 of this Pamphlet. 
3.6.2.4.4.  The parameters listed in the Tables of Attachment 4 are used as the starting 
point to determine what aircraft information is recorded. 
3.6.2.4.5.  Table A4.1 parameters in Attachment 4 are recorded on all aircraft, as 
applicable, for mishap investigations and require a waiver if the parameter is not 
recorded by a crash survivable flight data recorder. Table A4.2 parameters in 
Attachment 4 are also recorded for new acquisition aircraft and for existing aircraft if 
a sensor for the information is installed and the data is accessible via a data stream on 
the aircraft; otherwise, recording of Table A4.2 parameters is desired. 
3.6.2.4.6.  Determine the applicability of each required parameter to the particular 
aircraft under consideration. For example, some parameters are applicable only to 
fixed-wing aircraft, or only to rotary-wing aircraft, or only to tanker aircraft, or only to 
powered-lift aircraft. 
3.6.2.4.6.1.  For each applicable parameter: identify if it is currently recorded 
(including how/where) or develop a plan to obtain recording capability. 
3.6.2.4.6.2.  For each non-applicable parameter: identify rationale for non-
applicability. 
3.6.2.4.6.3.  Other applicable parameters not included in the Tables are added as 
determined appropriate by the Recorded Aircraft Information IPT (see paragraph 
3.8.1 in this chapter for additional information). 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
33 
3.6.2.4.7.  Identify methods to cost effectively record, retrieve, secure, and disseminate 
aircraft information that can assist in determining the causes of aircraft mishaps, 
reducing operating cost, anticipating equipment failure, detecting faulty operational 
procedures, forecasting remaining aircraft life based on structural data, and optimizing 
engine maintenance through the use of engine data. 
3.6.2.4.8.  Review FAR Part 25 Section 1459, Flight Data Recorders, and FAR Part 25 
Section 1457, Cockpit Voice Recorders, for applicability to each program (or these 
same sections in FAR Part 23, Part 27 or Part 29 as appropriate). 
3.6.2.4.9.  Determine the extent data link communications are to be recorded either 
onboard or at the receiving ground station for platforms with data link messaging 
capability. 
3.6.2.4.10.  Validate any requirements to inhibit devices employed to enable the 
recovery of the crew and information recorders in the event of a mishap if determined 
necessary to address combat operational concerns. 
3.6.2.4.11.  Consider the use of encryption in the system design if unique wartime 
and/or peacetime security concerns dictate that geographical, flight path, data link or 
performance parameters are classified. The Recorded Aircraft Information IPT 
addresses issues such as perishability of the classified data, access to crypto keys 
following a mishap, and determine access to the decrypted data. If encryption is 
determined not to be a viable option, the Recorded Aircraft Information IPT will 
consider the ability to inhibit recording of certain parameters as determined by security 
concerns and prepare data sanitization procedures in case of unintentional recording of 
classified data to return the system to an unclassified state. This capability will be 
validated by the customer of the information and utilized only as unique operational 
requirements dictate. Sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary and capricious deletion 
of information will be considered as part of the system design. 
3.6.2.4.12.  Determine the most cost effective means to achieve the recording 
capability that meets the identified information needs and addresses non-compliant 
Recorded Aircraft Information requirements. 
3.6.2.4.12.1.  To record all possible information on every aircraft may be both cost-
prohibitive and unrealistic; however, achieving a balance between parameter 
availability, optimization for the information customers, and cost avoidance is the 
desired outcome. 
3.6.2.4.12.2.  Cost-benefit analyses are performed to determine the cost 
effectiveness of accomplishing various possible options for achieving the required 
information recording capability. 
3.6.2.4.13.  Recommend solutions chosen to best meet information-recording 
requirements and develop plan for implementing the recommended solution(s). 
3.6.2.4.14.  Determine the appropriate inspection intervals for validating the quality 
and functionality of all Recorded Aircraft Information components. 
3.6.2.4.15.  Document completion of the above actions. Developing an Aircraft 
Information Management Plan (AIMP) is recommended for documenting Recorded 
34 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Aircraft Information IPT activities (see paragraph 3.8 below for additional 
information). 
3.6.2.4.16.  Stay abreast of proposed/planned aircraft modifications for potential 
impacts to Recorded Aircraft Information and those that may enable collection of 
additional data. 
3.6.2.4.17.  Advocate for funding of recommended solution(s) and assist in developing 
waiver requests as requested by the Lead Command. 
3.7.  Additional Information on the use of Mishap Parameter Tables. 
3.7.1.  When conducting the systematic assessment of information needs, the parameters listed 
in Attachment 4 of this Pamphlet will be used to determine what information is required to be 
recorded on an aircraft. Table A4.1 and Table A4.2. in Attachment 4 reflect an extensive list 
of parameters available for recording on fixed-wing, rotary-wing and powered lift aircraft. 
These parameters are essential to investigative and preventative operations and logistics 
efforts. 
3.7.2.  Although the list is extensive, there is always a tendency to include “just one more” 
parameter that could be captured. Additionally, military aircraft may have mission specific or 
special equipment status that is also recorded. For example, an aircraft equipped with a helmet 
mounted cuing system records the pilot’s head and/or eye position and a jump-qualified aircraft 
records the status of the jump light indicating system as well as open/closed statuses for doors 
and ramps. So, while the list may appear complete, mission needs and requirements could 
dictate a more extensive list when deciding on data recording requirements. 
3.8.  Developing an Aircraft Information Management Plan (AIMP). 
3.8.1.  The Recorded Aircraft Information IPT will develop an AIMP for each program to 
document the information requirements for the platform; the current information recording 
system capability, processes and infrastructure; shortfalls between available and needed data; 
compliance/non-compliance with Recorded Aircraft Information requirements; most cost 
effective means to address shortfalls; analysis of alternatives and/or cost-benefit analyses for 
options considered; and recommended actions for future efforts. An AIMP template is 
provided in Attachment 2. The AIMP is an active/living document that is updated preceding 
each milestone decision point or as program changes occur. The following steps/considerations 
are utilized in creating the AIMP: 
3.8.1.1.  Determine all aircraft information customers/stakeholders (i.e., who needs 
information off the aircraft?). At a minimum, this includes safety investigation boards, 
system/subsystem integrity programs, mFOQA, Reliability Centered Maintenance, CBM, 
and Joint Advanced Health and Usage Monitoring System. 
3.8.1.2.  Determine what information is generated by the aircraft and what information is 
recorded by existing systems. 
3.8.1.3.  Identify how and when the information comes off the aircraft and the classification 
of the information. Determine where the information goes and what is done with it. 
3.8.1.4.  Perform a gap analysis to determine if capabilities meet Recorded Aircraft 
Information requirements in Attachment 4 Tables or where they fall short. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
35 
3.8.1.5.  Develop Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimates for modifications required 
to address any identified shortfalls (ROMs can be developed in-house and/or by a 
contractor). Avoid single, monolithic ROMs of what it would take to fix everything; instead 
stratify modifications in a way that makes sense (e.g., easy versus difficult, cheap versus 
expensive, or short-term versus long-term). 
3.8.1.6.  Consider all forms of information (i.e., acoustic, imagery, data link and 
parametric, regardless of recording media or transmission method) when arriving at an 
integrated solution for the program. 
3.8.1.7.  Determine IT systems where the collected data is hosted and evaluate data 
interface requirements. 
3.8.1.8.  Realize that by combining information requirements, several customers may be 
served by the same recorder. 
3.8.1.9.  Conduct analysis of alternatives and/or cost-benefit analyses for different options 
being considered to determine the most cost effective system solution. 
3.8.1.10.  Upon completion, the AIMP is endorsed by the PM and provided to the Lead 
Command as supporting information to prepare funding requests and/or required waiver 
requests. 
3.8.1.11.  Be prepared for customer and/or information collection modifications as aircraft 
mission, aircraft capability and technology changes. 
3.9.  Recommended DAFI 63-101/20-101 Recorded Aircraft Information Waiver Process. 
3.9.1.  In accordance with DAFI 63-101/20-101, Lead Commands (as assigned by DAFPD 10-
9) administer any necessary Recorded Aircraft Information waivers for weapon systems under 
their responsibility. Exceptions may be made when a command has Lead responsibilities for a 
specialized variant of a platform (e.g., MC-130 assigned to AFSOC) but the Lead Command 
for the basic platform (e.g., AMC for C-130) is responsible for data recording capability. 
3.9.2.  The Lead Command Director of Safety develops waiver requests to address Recorded 
Aircraft Information deficiencies identified by the PM. Waiver requests address which 
parameter or recording requirements are not currently met, which requirements are planned to 
be met through modifications or upgrades, the timeline and cost estimate/funding plan for those 
modifications or upgrades, proposed steps/methods needed to meet the remaining requirements 
(including cost estimate/funding plan and timeline), and any requirements that cannot be met, 
along with justification for why they cannot be met. A template is provided in Attachment 3 
for guidance. 
3.9.3.  In accordance with DAFI 63-101/20-101, waiver requests are endorsed by 
MAJCOM/A3/A4/A5 and coordinated with AF/SE before submittal to the Lead Command/CC 
for consideration and disposition. AF/SE validates the accuracy and completeness of the 
package and the adequacy of recommended solutions before presentation to the waiver 
decision authority. The Lead Command/CC is the sole waiver authority for Recorded Aircraft 
Information requirements. Lead Command Directors of Safety notify AF/SE of all approved 
waivers. 
3.9.4.  When granted, a waiver remains in force until the execution plan is implemented or the 
waiver is rescinded. If the plan upon which a waiver was granted is not executed, the waiver 
36 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
package is re-accomplished within six months following determination that the plan cannot be 
executed. In addition, if a new recording system is installed, a new waiver package is 
accomplished if all Recorded Aircraft Information requirements are not met.

Chapter 4 
CREW STATION WORKING GROUPS, MAINTAINER INTERFFACE WORKING 
GROUPS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN SYSTEM DESIGN 
4.1.  Overview of CSWGs and MIWGs. 
4.1.1.  Crew Station Working Groups (CSWGs) and Maintainer Interface Working Groups 
(MIWGs) are the new names for groups that support aircraft operations, maintenance, and crew 
station development, replacing the old term Cockpit Working Groups. 
4.2.  Applicability of CSWGs and MIWGs. 
4.2.1.  For every Air Force program that involves crew station design, development, or 
modification, Program Managers should consider establishing CSWG and/or a MIWG as a 
recommended best practice to facilitate implementing the crew station and maintainer 
interface-related requirements of DAFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. 
This chapter contains the objectives, membership, and organizational responsibilities of 
CSWGs and MIWGs. Refer to CSB-004, Crew Station Working Group (CSWG) and 
Maintainer Interface Working Group (MIWG), for more detailed program guidance on 
CSWG/MIWG development and execution. 
4.3.  Crew Station and Maintainer Interface Working Groups. 
4.3.1.  Crew Station, Maintainer Interface, and Working Group Definitions. 
4.3.1.1.  Crew stations include but are not limited to cockpits, flight decks, remote operator 
stations, or mission operator stations such as: battle management, reconnaissance, 
electronic warfare, or aerial refueling operator stations. 
4.3.1.2.  Maintainer interfaces include, but are not limited to electronic maintenance 
systems (e.g., diagnostics systems), physical aircraft interfaces of areas not occupied by 
aircrew, personal equipment worn to assist or protect maintainers, and individual Line 
Replaceable Units (LRUs). 
4.3.2.  Purpose. 
4.3.2.1.  CSWGs and MIWGs serve to ensure good human factors engineering principles 
are employed throughout system design, development, and modification. Through the 
Program Office, the CSWG and MIWG offer a unified government position on matters 
pertaining to design, development, and modification of crew stations and maintainer 
interfaces. 
4.3.2.2.  The CSWG and MIWG base their positions on members’ collective experience 
and technical knowledge. Since the WGs cannot change contractual requirements, each 
WG submits recommended changes for PM and Lead Command approval regarding any 
aspects of the crew station / maintainer interface design that that the WG determines likely 
to affect the contract (cost, schedule, and/or performance). Changes approved by the PM / 
Lead Command are incorporated by the contracting officer. 
4.3.2.3.  The CSWG and MIWG objectives, activities, membership, and responsibilities 
below are based on lessons learned during decades of experience with crew station design. 
38 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
4.3.3.  CSWG and MIWG Objectives. 
4.3.3.1.  Provide the PM with technical guidance and a current operational perspective to 
help evaluate the operational suitability and effectiveness of the proposed crew station and 
maintainer interface designs using human factors evaluation techniques including, but not 
limited to: situation awareness assessments, workload evaluations, control/display 
evaluations, and task analyses. 
4.3.3.2.  Clarify and evaluate operational tasks and critical mission elements, then evaluate 
designs to ensure that aircrew and maintainers can perform these tasks across simulated 
mission scenarios. 
4.3.3.3.  Act as the formal lead liaison between the Program Office and prime contractor 
in the earliest stages of the crew station and maintainer interface design process. 
4.3.3.4.  Ensure the use of appropriate levels of simulations throughout all CSWG involved 
processes in the program’s lifecycle. 
4.3.3.5.  Provide an audit trail for decisions on crew station and maintainer interface issues. 
4.3.4.  CSWG Membership and Responsibilities. 
4.3.4.1.  CSWGs include both members and advisors. 
4.3.4.2.  CSWG Members: Members need a broad understanding of their organization, and 
its concerns as they relate to aircrew. They provide crew station design recommendations 
to the CSWG chairperson. Appointment lengths are determined per established WG charter 
and should be long enough to ensure continuity of critical information. Through the 
Program Office, the CSWG offers a unified government position on matters pertaining to 
crew station development and modification. Required members and their respective 
responsibilities include the following: 
4.3.4.3.  The CSWG chairperson:  The chairperson, as selected by the PM, establishes the 
CSWG during EMD (or equivalent phase for other AAF program pathways) or as early as 
possible. The chair contacts AFLCMC/EZFC for information on how to establish and 
organize the CSWG. 
4.3.4.3.1.  Typically, the role of CSWG chairperson is fulfilled by the Crew Systems 
Engineer assigned to the program. However, the prime contractor counterpart to the 
Crew Systems Engineer can be a co-chair. 
4.3.4.3.2.  The chairperson coordinates with each of the members’ organizations to 
ensure each member representative meets membership qualifications. The chairperson 
may appoint additional qualified members and/or advisors such as pilot physicians, 
safety representatives, and engineering support as necessary. It is the responsibility of 
the chairperson to manage the list of CSWG attendees. The chairperson also writes and 
maintains the WG charter for the program. 
4.3.4.3.3.  The chairperson is responsible for maintaining a database of current and 
accurate CSWG meeting records, as well as CSWG design decisions and issues. Design 
decisions are recorded using decision documents, which are also described in CSB-004 
for guidance. It is also the chairperson’s responsibility to ensure the appropriate use of 
simulation across all CSWG-involved processes. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
39 
4.3.4.3.4.  Lastly, the chairperson establishes a Crew Station Evaluation Team to 
support the CSWG with inputs on the operational environment, objectives, and 
proposed system designs. 
4.3.4.4.  Crew station or human factors engineering representative. This non-contractor 
(i.e., government civilian or military) position typically serves as the CSWG chairperson 
as appointed by the PM and provides leadership and expertise on the crew station design 
and evaluation. 
4.3.4.5.  Senior aircrew representatives from the requirements and the operations offices of 
the Lead Command, operational commands and National Air Guard or reserve 
components, as necessary. 
4.3.4.5.1.  These members are appointed by the operational command based on their 
level of expertise. They provide the CSWG with expertise for the analysis of the crew 
station design and clarify the critical elements to the CSWG and system developer. 
4.3.4.5.2.  These members will also develop or assess suitability of mission scenarios 
for use in dynamic simulations used for design evaluation. 
4.3.4.6.  An Air Force Flight Standards Agency representative. The Air Force Flight 
Standards Agency representative is the instrument flight expert for the CSWG and assesses 
proposed crew station design for instrument flying requirements. 
4.3.4.7.  A representative from the Lead Development Test and Evaluation Organization 
or Air Force Test Center. The Lead Developmental Test and Evaluation Organization 
Evaluation Test Organization or Air Force Test Center member provides a developmental 
test perspective on proposed crew station designs based on lessons learned from 
developmental flight-testing. 
4.3.4.8.  An Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) representative. 
The AFOTEC member evaluates proposed crew station designs for functionality and early 
operational utility based on lessons learned. 
4.3.4.9.  Advisors are subject matter experts used to help identify cockpit/remote operator 
station design issues and provide technical input that members can use as the basis for 
recommendations. 
4.3.5.  MIWG Membership and Responsibilities. 
4.3.5.1.  MIWGs also include both members and advisors. Members need a broad 
understanding of their organization and its concerns as it relates to maintainers. They make 
maintainer interface design recommendations to the MIWG chairperson. Appointment 
length is determined per established charter, and should be long enough to ensure 
continuity of critical information. Similar to CSWGs, the MIWG also bases its position on 
members’ collective experience and technical knowledge. Since the MIWG cannot change 
contractual requirements, the WG must obtain approval from the PM and Lead Command 
for any recommended changes to design, development, modification, or test and evaluation 
that the WG determines likely to affect the contract (cost, schedule, and/or performance). 
Approved changes are incorporated by the contracting officer. Members and their 
respective responsibilities include: 
40 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
4.3.5.1.1.  The MIWG chairperson(s). The chairperson, as selected by the PM, 
establishes the MIWG during EMD or as early as possible. The selected chairperson 
can contact AFLCMC/EZFC for information on how to establish and organize the 
MIWG. Typically, the Crew Systems Engineer assigned to the program is assigned the 
role of MIWG chairperson. The chairperson coordinates with each of the members’ 
commands to ensure each member representative meets the qualifications. It is the 
responsibility of the chairperson to manage the list of MIWG attendees. The 
chairperson also writes and maintains the charter for the program. The chairperson 
maintains a database of MIWG design decisions and issues. As with CSWGs, MIWG 
design decisions are documented using decision documents as described in CSB-004. 
The chairperson is also responsible for maintaining current and accurate MIWG 
meeting records. The MIWG chairperson may appoint additional members and/or 
advisors as necessary. 
4.3.5.1.2.  Crew Systems Engineering representative. The Crew Systems Engineering 
representative is a non-contractor (i.e., government civilian or military) position that 
typically serves as the MIWG chairperson as appointed by the PM. This person 
provides human factors input on the maintainer interface design and evaluation. The 
prime contractor counterpart to the crew systems engineer can also serve as an MIWG 
co-chair. 
4.3.5.1.3.  Senior maintainer representatives from the requirements and operations 
offices of the Lead Command, operational commands, and reserve components as 
deemed necessary. 
4.3.5.1.3.1.  These members assess the maintainer interface design based on 
experience and lessons learned. 
4.3.5.1.3.2.  These members also include operational maintainers in the field. 
4.3.5.1.4.  The MIWG chairperson may appoint advisors to help identify maintainer 
interface design issues and provide input that can serve as a basis for recommendations. 
4.3.6.  CSWG and MIWG References. 
4.3.6.1.  Guidance on writing a charter for CSWGs and MIWGs is contained within CSB-
004, which is managed by AFLCMC/EZFC. Similarly, samples of design decision 
documents are also contained with the Bulletin. Programs are strongly recommended to 
refer to the guidance in the Bulletin in conjunction with this chapter when establishing and 
managing CSWGs and MIWGs, and to contact the Crew Systems Engineering and Human 
Systems Integration Enterprise Branch (AFLCMC/EZFC) for additional information and 
training on establishing CSWGs and MIWGs. 
4.4.  Overview of Anthropometry Guidance for System Design 
4.4.1.  This section provides guidance and best practices for program management and system 
design regarding the physical accommodation of humans interfacing with aircraft systems. 
This section’s guidance focuses on tasks, roles, and responsibilities in an acquisition context. 
For detailed practitioner guidance on AF anthropometric requirements, specifications, and 
verification methods, refer to CSB-001, Aircrew Accommodation Requirements / Verification. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
41 
4.5.  Applicability of Anthropometry Guidance 
4.5.1.  The anthropometry guidance in this chapter applies to all formal DAF acquisition 
programs, including new systems and modifications of existing systems. These systems 
include but are not limited to crew stations, aircraft maintainer interfaces, and aircrew flight 
equipment. 
4.6.  Responsibilities 
4.6.1.  Program Manager 
4.6.1.1.  The PM is responsible to coordinate with the Lead Command, lead MAJCOM 
requirements office, and System Program Office (SPO) Crew Systems Engineers to ensure 
that minimum anthropometric accommodation requirements are written, validated, and 
maintained for each formal acquisition program and for modifications to systems. 
4.6.1.2.  The PM is responsible to coordinate with the SPO Crew Systems Engineer to 
ensure that aircraft systems meet or exceed the minimum anthropometric design 
specifications that are mandated in of DAFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle 
Management. Table 4.1 provides the current minimum anthropometric design 
specifications. 
4.6.1.2.1.  The PM is responsible to coordinate with AFLCMC/EZFC to verify the most 
current design specifications, as these specifications will be updated with ongoing and 
future AF anthropometric studies. 
4.6.1.2.2.  These minimum design specifications consist of physical accommodation 
boundary cases that include a variety of anthropometric measurements, and ensure that 
at least the central 95% of the U.S. recruiting population are accommodated when all 
cases are met. 
4.6.1.2.3.  The PM is also responsible to ensure that modifications to an existing system 
will not prevent that system from meeting these boundary cases. 
4.6.1.3.  The PM and the SPO Crew Systems Engineer are responsible to coordinate with 
AFLCMC/EZFC to obtain the latest minimum anthropometric design specifications when 
considering making changes to aircrew or operator station designs, or when defining design 
specifications for new aircrew or operator station designs. They should also coordinate 
with AFLCMC/WNU to ensure that their program is employing the most current 
anthropometric boundary cases in their testing and evaluation efforts. 
4.6.1.4.  The PM is responsible to consult with the SPO Crew Systems Engineer to ensure 
that each crew station, maintainer interface and/or aircrew flight equipment being 
developed or modified has corresponding anthropometric SRD and contractual 
requirements document language that detail its physical dimensions to accommodate the 
boundary cases in the minimum anthropometric design specifications. 
4.6.1.5.  The PM is responsible to coordinate with the SPO Lead Test Manager to ensure 
that aircraft systems’ physical design specifications are validated and meet the minimum 
anthropometric accommodation requirements. 
4.6.2.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFCLMC) 
42 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
4.6.2.1.  AFLCMC/EZFC 
and 
AFLCMC/WNU 
are 
responsible 
to 
document 
anthropometric design specifications for DAF programs and modifications, accomplish 
any additional analysis to ensure the widest possible range of the U.S. recruiting population 
are accommodated by the physical design, and to advocate anthropometric accommodation 
needs throughout the design specification process. 
4.6.2.2.  AFLCMC/EZFC and AFLCMC/WNU Airmen Accommodation Lab (AAL) are 
responsible to conduct long-term anthropometric studies to expand on the existing 
minimum design specifications to better represent the current U.S. recruiting population as 
accurately and broadly as possible, across all races and genders. 
4.6.2.3.  AFLCMC/EZFC and AFLCMC/WNU should coordinate with PMs and SPO 
Crew System Engineers to ensure that design specification activities include current 
anthropometric data and account for updates to these data from planned or ongoing studies. 
4.7.  Anthropometry Design Selection Best Practices 
4.7.1.  SPOs should give preference to physical design solutions that accommodate more than 
the minimum of the central 95 percent of the U.S. recruiting population. Contractual 
specification documents should include threshold requirements defining the minimum 
accommodation level for the anthropometric measurements listed in Table 4.1, and an 
objective requirement to accommodate the widest possible range of these measurements. 
4.7.1.1.  To the extent that greater flexibility in the minimum accommodation level is 
necessary due to mission impact, consider inserting language in the contract solicitation 
permitting offerors to submit proposals that depart from the minimum anthropometric 
accommodation requirements only if the contractor can provide sufficient justification by 
means of significant fiscal restraints, mission risk, and/or mission degradation. 
4.7.1.2.  When circumstances arise that prevent meeting the central 95 percent 
accommodation of the U.S. recruiting population threshold, a waiver must be granted from 
the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the program. The SAE may choose to delegate 
waiver authority.

Office is the certification authority for aircraft-store compatibility efforts. 
Aircraft-Stores Compatibility—The ability of an aircraft, stores, stores management systems, 
and related suspension equipment to coexist without unacceptable effects of one of the 
aerodynamic, structural, electrical, or functional characteristics of the others under all flight and 
ground conditions expected to be experienced by the aircraft-store combination. A particular store 
may be compatible with an aircraft in a specific configuration, although not necessarily so with all 
pylons (or stations) under all conditions. MIL-HDBK-244A, Guide to Aircraft/Stores 
Compatibility, contains basic guidelines for evaluating aircraft-store compatibility and specifies 
an acceptable separation must meet pertinent weapon operational criteria, and outlines DOD 
standardized procedures for the certification (safe carriage and safe/acceptable separation) of 
stores on aircraft. 
Ballistics Accuracy Verification—The determination of the accuracy of the weapon digital data 
program used with the trajectory model contained in the aircraft Operational Flight Program and 
the ballistics tables/weapons delivery technical order, through testing and analysis. Verification 
confirms the capability of the aircraft and store combination to meet user accuracy and bias 
requirements. The aircraft weapons delivery Operational Flight Program and updated Technical 
Order ballistics are fielded after verification testing. Additionally, a ballistics accuracy verification 
report compares weapon delivery results with user accuracy criteria. 
Certification Data Package—A Store Certification Data is the primary data package used to 
ensure stores are physically, mechanically, electromagnetically, environmentally, structurally, and 
aerodynamically compatible with Air Force aircraft systems. It also ensures that the required data 
is present to produce the necessary Technical Orders. The Store Certification Data is composed of 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
51 
the Engineering Data Package, Weapon Source Data Package, and Standard Source Data Package 
in Attachment 9. 
Compatibility Agency—An organization (Program Office, Contractor, other DoD service, etc.), 
other than AFSEO, which is designated the aircraft-store compatibility lead and provides 
engineering support to the aircraft or store Program Office. 
Compatibility of Aircraft and Stores—The ability of an aircraft to carry and release the store 
and related suspension equipment without unacceptable effects upon the aerodynamic, 
electromagnetic (excluding high-altitude electromagnetic pulse), structural, or functional 
characteristics of either the aircraft or store under expected flight and ground conditions. 
MILHDBK-244, Guide to Aircraft-Stores Compatibility, contains basic guidelines for evaluating 
aircraft-store compatibility and specifies an acceptable separation to meet pertinent weapon 
operational criteria and outlines DoD standardized procedures for the certification (safe carriage 
and safe acceptable separation) of stores on aircraft. 
Customer Commitment Date—The date the AFSEO estimates the project deliverable will be 
provided to the aircraft or store Program Office. 
Decertification—A store no longer in use by the United States Air Force.

Manager are the same. See Store Program Manager. 
Immediate Warfighter Need—Immediate Warfighter Need - A subset of Joint Urgent 
Operational Needs identified by the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell and has a materiel or logistics 
solution that must be resolved within 120 days or less. 
Joint Emergent Operations Need (JEON)—A Joint Emergent Operations Need that is identified 
by a Combatant Command as inherently joint and impacting an anticipated or pending contingency 
operation. 
Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)—A Joint Urgent Operational Need identifies and 
subsequently gains Joint Staff validation and resourcing of a solution desired within days or weeks, 
to meet a specific high-priority need  
Limited certification—Provided at the request of the using command to have a capability in the 
field while a routine certification and ballistics accuracy verification tasks are being accomplished. 
May consist of a limited employment envelope (not flight-tested), unverified Operational Flight 
Program, or manual ballistics only. Publication of technical data is required. For example, message 
flight clearance, operational supplements, and preliminary Technical Orders. 
Mission Critical—A higher priority project such as an Urgent Operational Need and a Joint 
Emergent Operational Need, which are high valued interest projects designated by SECAF, (i.e., 
Nuclear Systems). 
Mission Design Series—Standard nomenclature used to identify aircraft and missiles.

procedures, personnel, equipment, facilities, and organizations are capable of performing assigned 
nuclear weapon functions and missions. The Air Force Nuclear Certification Program has two 
52 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
major components: Design Certification and Operational Certification. Refer to AFI 63-125 for 
details. 
Project Plan—The Project Plan is an agreement between the AFSEO, the Program Office, 
SAF/AQP, and Lead Commands regarding the projects’ priority requirements, schedule, 
and costs. The Project Plan includes cost—schedule-performance trade-off options and impacts 
on other SEEK EAGLE efforts, if applicable. Project Plans are not required for projects that have 
an estimated cost less than $25K. 
Reliability Centered Maintenance—An analytical process to determine the appropriate failure 
management strategies, including preventive maintenance requirements and other actions needed 
to ensure safe operations while balancing readiness and costs. 
Risk Assessment—An evaluation of the risk associated with a given test event, a test series, or

Routine certification—Requires the completion of all activities required to certify the aircraft-
store configurations requested in the SER. These activities include planning; analysis; tests; 
documentation; development; publication and fielding of pertinent technical manuals applicable 
to loading, carriage, and employment, which include the verified ballistics data in the -34 and -25 
Technical Orders; and the incorporation of the appropriate software changes, resulting from 
ballistics accuracy verification of the Operational Flight Program. 
Stores—Any device intended for internal or external carriage, mounted at aircraft suspension point 
locations, which may or may not intend to be separated in flight from the aircraft. Stores include 
missiles, rockets, bombs, nuclear weapons, mines, fuel and spray tanks, torpedoes, detachable fuel 
and spray tanks, dispensers, pods, targets, chaff and flares, decoys, other expendables, and 
suspension equipment. In this pamphlet, guns mounted internally to the structure of an aircraft are 
not considered stores for SEEK EAGLE purposes, but chaff, flare, and towed decoy magazines 
are considered aircraft suspension and release equipment whether mounted internally or externally. 
A SEEK EAGLE store for annual stores forecasting purposes is any store as described above that 
is used for dedicated SEEK EAGLE testing. (Refer to MIL-STD-8591) 
Store Program Manager—The single face to the customer for a store program. The Program 
Manager directs one or more programs and is accountable for cost, schedule, and performance to 
the Program Executive Officer. The Program Manager is vested with full authority, responsibility, 
and resources to execute a program on behalf of the Air Force. For purposes of this document, the 
terms Store Item Manager and Store Program Manager are the same. 
Suspension Equipment—Any device, such as pylons, racks, adaptors, launchers, and 
countermeasure dispensers used to carry and/or release other stores. Suspension equipment is 
considered a store unless it is part of the aircraft. 
Technical Data—Technical Data required to perform engineering analysis in support of aircraft-
store compatibility efforts. The compatibility agency provides the Program Office with technical 
data required to complete the SER. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024

Threshold Weapon—Threshold weapons are defined in an aircraft's respective Acquisition 
Program Baseline or validated capabilities documents, and are typically inventory weapons that 
new aircraft will integrate onto the aircraft. 
Urgent Operational Need (UON—)—Capability requirements identified by a DoD Component 
as affecting an ongoing or anticipated contingency operation. 
User Need Date—The date Lead Command or SAF/IA, or other organizational customer, requires 
all SEEK EAGLE Certification activities to be completed, to include the delivery of all Technical 
Orders to support implementation, together with Operational Flight Program ballistics updates. 
The user need date is normally six months before Initial Operational Capability for developmental 
or major modified aircraft and stores to permit lead-time for training and evaluation before 
implementation. For inventory stores and aircraft, the user need date is a balance between 
operational and threat requirement and the practical capability to meet that requirement.

A2.2.  Introduction.  Suggested language for the introduction is as follows: 
A2.2.1.  The purpose of this Aircraft Information Management Plan (AIMP) is to document 
Recorded Aircraft Information requirements by identifying the information produced by and 
the customer needs of the <subject aircraft system>. All forms of information (i.e., acoustic, 
imagery, data link and parametric, regardless of recording media or transmission method) have 
been considered in arriving at an integrated solution to program information needs. 
A2.2.2.  This AIMP was developed by the <subject aircraft> Recorded Aircraft Information 
Integrated Product Team (IPT) to address the information requirements for the platform; the 
current information recording system capability, processes and infrastructure; shortfalls 
between available and needed data; compliance/non-compliance with Recorded Aircraft 
Information requirements; most cost effective means to address shortfalls; analysis of 
alternatives and/or cost-benefit analyses for options considered; and recommended actions for 
future efforts.

FROM:  MAJCOM/SE  
 
SUBJECT:  Waiver to DAFI 63-101/20-101 Recorded Aircraft Information Requirements  
 
DAFI 63-101/20-101 directs each Air Force weapon system that requires AF airworthiness approval to evaluate 
and integrate aircraft information requirements. Integrating these data requirements requires a systematic 
assessment of the aircraft’s information needs to ensure the capture of critical information and the optimization of 
benefit while minimizing cost. Recording of crash survivable parametric and acoustic information to support 
mishap investigation is the minimum required Recorded Aircraft Information capability defined in DAFI 63-
101/20-101. Waiver to these requirements has been endorsed by MAJCOM/A3/A4/A5 and coordinated with 
AF/SE before submittal to <Lead Command>/CC for consideration and disposition.  
The <subject aircraft> Recorded Aircraft Information Integrated Product Team (IPT) has determined the <subject 
aircraft> is unable to meet the full requirements of DAFI 63-101/20101 at this time. This waiver request 
summarizes the technological, cost, and timeline issues detailed in the <subject aircraft> Recorded Aircraft 
Information IPT documentation (e.g., an Aircraft Information Management Plan (AIMP) at Attachment 2 in this 
AFPAM). 
 
Requirement Baseline.  
Address what requirements have not been met. Is it a recording capability (i.e., Crash  
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
59 
Survivable Flight Data Recorder, Cockpit Voice Recorder), a locator device, data verification process, or is it a 
required mishap information parameter from AFPAM 63-129, Attachment 4. Is a parameter not recorded at all or 
is it not recorded to the fidelity required?  
 
Consider providing a spreadsheet as an attachment that lists the requirements and parameters, which are not 
satisfied, various solutions considered, proposed resolution and justification for the proposed solutions (see 
example Attachment A3.1, Recorded Aircraft Information Parameters for Waiver Spreadsheet).  
Cost Estimates to Meet Requirements.  
Summarize costs to implement various solutions, referencing Recorded Aircraft Information IPT documentation 
for details. 
 
Analysis. 
Provide a summary of the cost-benefit analysis and implementation timeline for the various solutions considered, 
referencing the Recorded Aircraft Information IPT documentation for details. Keep in mind that some of the 
solutions considered may not meet all the Recorded Aircraft Information requirements, which is where the cost-
benefit analysis comes in. The goal is to get “the most bang for the buck.” Recommendation.  
 
State the recommended solution, rationale, and outline the funding plan and implementation schedule (if 
applicable). Provide sufficient justification if the recommendation is to make no modifications. Note: a waiver 
can be either temporary or permanent (or a combination of the two). A temporary waiver is based on an execution 
plan for a programmed or proposed modifications/upgrade that addresses non-compliance requirements. A 
permanent waiver is justified with the reason(s) expending funds cannot efficiently meet non-compliant 
requirements. Approval of a permanent waiver does not indicate the requirement will not be reconsidered as 
future modifications are proposed or technology changes, it merely indicates that a further waiver is not required.  
 
Request a temporary waiver to the <specific> Recorded Aircraft Information requirements of DAFI 63-101/20-
101 and processes detailed in AFPAM 63-129 until the <recommended solutions> plan is executed, as outlined 
above.  
 
--AND/OR—Request a permanent waiver to the <specific> Recorded Aircraft Information requirements of DAFI 
63-101/20-101 and processes in AFPAM 63-129 due to the <reason> as outlined above.

Aircraft does not 
have a crash 
survivable recorder 
to collect data for 
mishap investigation. 
The aircraft has been 
in the AF inventory 
since 1954 and crash 
survivable flight data 
recorders (CSFDRs) 
were not a 
requirement when 
the aircraft was 
fielded. 
1.  Install CSFDR 
and sensors 
necessary for data 
collection (has 
weight and cost 
implications as 
identified in AIMP). 
2.  Install lipstick 
cameras to record 
flight instruments, 
and a data collection 
package, that 
includes an ability to 
digitize the video, 
store the data in a 
crash-survivable 
format, and later 
analyze the data (has 
RDT&E and 
acquisition costs and 
timeline implications 
as identified in 
AIMP). 
3.  Request waiver to 
data recorder 
requirement due to 
cost and technical 
difficulty of 
installing a crash-
survivable data 
collection capability 
(cost estimates and 
technical analysis 
provided in AIMP). 
Request a waiver to 
the data recorder 
requirement (see 
cost-benefit analysis 
justification in 
AIMP). Current AF 
Service Life plan for 
this platform is to 
retire within 8 years. 
Though a promising 
technological 
solution, the 
additional time 
needed to validate 
the technical 
feasibility of 
digitalizing flight 
parameters recorded 
on video means this 
option is not 
available until 2 
years prior to the 
planned platform 
retirement date.

Possible solutions 
considered  
Proposed resolution 
and justification  
Aircraft does not 
have a cockpit voice 
recorder to collect 
acoustic data for 
mishap investigation. 
The aircraft flight 
data recorder (FDR) 
was installed in 1982 
and voice recording 
was not a 
requirement at that 
time. 
1.  Incorporate voice 
capability in a 
replacement FDR 
since the current 
recorder is facing 
obsolescence issues 
(has weight and cost 
implications as 
identified in AIMP). 
2.  Request waiver to 
voice recorder 
requirement (cost 
estimates and 
technical analysis 
provided in AIMP). 
Add voice-recording 
capability with 
planned replacement 
FDR scheduled for 
procurement 
beginning in FY12 
(see implementation 
timeline in AIMP). 
The installed cockpit 
voice recorder only 
has the capacity to 
record 30-minutes of 
data. 
The Air Force 
purchased an FAA 
certified cockpit 
voice recorder 
(CVR) and the FAA 
requirement for a 
CVR on this aircraft 
is only 30-minutes 
recording time. 
1.  Replace the CVR 
with an updated 
model capable of 
meeting the 2-hour 
record time (has cost 
implications as 
identified in AIMP). 
2.  Request waiver to 
CVR time recording 
requirement 
(technical analysis 
provided in AIMP). 
Request waiver to 2-
hour CVR recording 
requirement (see 
cost-benefit analysis 
justification in 
AIMP). Due to age 
of fleet and minimal 
previous mishap 
history, replacing the 
CVR is not cost-
effective.

Attachment 4 
RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS FOR AIRCRAFT CRASH SURVIVABLE 
PARAMETRIC AND ACOUSTIC DATA 
A4.1.  Purpose.  As cited in DAFI 63-101/20-101, paragraph A4.2 of this Attachment provides 
the minimum mandatory attributes of crash survivable flight data recorders for AF aircraft. NOTE:  
Attachment 4 is being converted to a Military Standard. 
A4.2.  Minimum Crash Survivable Data Recording Requirements. 
A4.2.1.  All Air Force air systems (manned aircraft or UAS classified as Group 3 or higher in 
accordance with DoD 6055.07) employ information recording systems consisting of those 
components deemed necessary in consideration of mishap investigation needs. In addition, 
IAW DAFI 63-101/20-101 aircraft Program Managers (PMs) integrate and optimize data 
recording capabilities that support mishap investigation with other data capabilities that 
support the operational usage, maintenance, and system integrity concept of the weapon 
system. 
A4.2.2.  A crash survivable information recording capability sufficient to facilitate mishap 
investigations, to include parametric and acoustic data recording equipment are installed on all 
applicable Air Force aircraft, as required by DAFI 63-101/20-101. Non-crash survivable data 
provided through telemetry methods and recorded at a ground station may substitute for on-
board recording capability. 
A4.2.2.1.  The crash survivable information recording capability will meet the mishap 
parameter requirements defined in Table A4.1 and Table A4.2 of this Attachment, as 
applicable. 
A4.2.2.1.1.  Crash survivable FDRs record a minimum of 25 hours (guidance from 
FAR 121.343). 
A4.2.2.1.2.  Crash survivable FDRs operate continuously from the time power is 
applied to the recorder during preflight or ground operations, until the recorder is shut 
down during the post-flight checklist or at the conclusion of ground operations. 
A4.2.2.1.3.  Crash survivable cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) record a minimum of 
two hours (guidance from FAR 121.359). 
A4.2.2.1.4.  CVRs record all aircrew voice communications, all communications 
between the aircraft and ground stations, and ambient cockpit/flight deck noises. 
A4.2.2.1.5.  CVRs operate continuously from the time power is applied to the recorder 
during preflight or the initiation of ground operations, until the recorder is shut down 
during the post-flight checklist or the conclusion of ground operations. 
A4.2.2.1.6.  All crash survivable recorders meet crashworthiness requirements for 
impact shock, penetration resistance, static crush, thermal shock (high and low 
temperature fire), deep sea pressure and sea water immersion, fluid immersion, beacon 
operation and deployment in accordance with recognized industry standards such as 
the latest revision of EUROCAE ED112, FAA TSO-C123c, and FAA TSO-C124c. 
66 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
A4.2.2.1.7.  In accordance with DAFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and 
Reports, the Air Force Safety Center Mishap Analysis & Animation Facility has the 
necessary equipment, procedures and training to enable recovery, transcription and 
analysis of crash survivable data recorded for mishap investigations. 
A4.2.2.2.  All applicable Air Force aircraft employ devices to enable the recovery of the 
crew and information recording devices in the event of a mishap. Examples of such devices 
include Emergency Locator Transmitters, Underwater Locator Beacons and Crash Position 
Indicators. Consideration may be given to inhibit these devices to address combat 
operational concerns. 
A4.2.2.3.  For aircraft equipped with crash survivable recorders for mishap investigation, 
the information recording equipment are included on the aircraft’s MESL. If a mission 
essential data recorder is non-operational, a one-time waiver for situations other than 
training (such as ferry to next repair point, weather evacuation, and urgent strategic nuclear 
missile security missions) may be granted in accordance with the applicable aircraft 
specific AFI 11-2, Volume 3. Provide notification of approved onetime waivers by 
electronic mail to the Air Force Safety Center at AFSEC.SEFE@us.af.mil. Actual 
combat/contingency employment and aircraft generated to a real-world alert status are the 
only exceptions to the one-time waiver requirement. 
A4.2.2.3.1.  Crash survivable data recorders will not be disabled, except to address 
mission security concerns. 
A4.2.2.3.2.  Periodic downloads of the crash survivable memory units are performed 
to verify the functionality and quality of the mishap data recording process, as well as 
the functionality of associated support equipment. 
A4.3.  Use of Mishap Parameter Tables.  When conducting the systematic assessment of 
information needs, the parameters listed in Tables A4.1 and A4.2 of this Pamphlet are used to 
determine what information is required to be recorded on an aircraft, IAW AFI 63101/20-101. The 
Tables were specifically crafted for military aircraft from participation in international working 
groups, recommendations of the NTSB and lessons learned from military safety investigation 
boards. 
A4.3.1.  The parameters identified in Table A4.1 are recorded for all existing and new 
acquisition aircraft (both fixed- and rotary-wing, as applicable) or a waiver IAW DAFI 63-
101/20-101 is required. The parameters identified in Table A4.2 are also recorded for new 
acquisition aircraft and for existing aircraft when a sensor for the information is installed and 
the data is available via a system bus on the aircraft; otherwise, recording of parameters is also 
desired but does not require a waiver. 
A4.3.2.  The number in the Mishap Parameter Count column indicates the running total of 
recommended parameters to be recorded for each table. A number with a letter suffix (e.g., 3a, 
3b, and 3c) indicates that any of the parameters with the letter suffix can be recorded to satisfy 
the overarching (i.e., 3) required parameter. Although only one of the suffixed number 
parameters is required to be recorded to meet the requirement, whenever possible it is preferred 
that all the suffixed number parameters be recorded to enable sub-system closed loop failure 
analysis. 
AFPAM63-129  18 SEPTEMBER 2024 
67 
A4.3.3.  A “√” in the mFOQA column indicates mishap-related parameters that also support 
an aircraft’s mFOQA program. It may be possible to integrate the recording and retrieval of 
these mishap data elements with other aircraft data requirements. PMs will evaluate those 
integration opportunities, without degrading the minimum crash survivable data recording and 
retrieval capability. 
A4.3.4.  The Range column indicates the set of values for specific sensor operation. The 
Interval column indicates the time in seconds between samples of a particular parameter. The 
Accuracy column indicates the maximum difference between the true value at sensor input and 
the recorded measured value of a parameter. Finally, the Resolution column indicates the 
smallest increment of a particular parameter that can be detected or reported.
