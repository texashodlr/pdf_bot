Chapter 1 
AIR FORCE S&T MANAGEMENT 
1.1.  Overview.  This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for planning, governance, 
and execution of the Air Force S&T Program.  The Air Force S&T Program consists of Basic 
Research, Applied Research, and Advanced Technology Development (research, development, 
test and evaluation [RDT&E] budget activity categories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively).  The 
S&T Program must be responsive to Air Force capability needs while guarding against 
technological surprise.  It includes in-house laboratory and contracted activities to produce both 
evolutionary and revolutionary technology-enabled opportunities. 
1.1.1.  The Air Force plans and executes its S&T Program in accordance with the approved 
Air Force S&T Strategy and the associated Air Force S&T Plan as influenced by both 
external and internal “drivers” [contact SAF/AQR for access to the latest versions of these 
documents].  S&T drivers may include the National Military Strategy (NMS), the 
Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Department of Defense (DoD) Guidance, Operating 
Concepts, wargames and exercises, long-term visionary reports and guidance and planning 
documents associated with the Air Force Strategic Planning System (AFSPS).  Furthermore, 
the Air Force strives to maintain an appropriately balanced investment portfolio across basic 
research, applied research, and advanced technology development. 
1.1.2.  Core Function Lead Integrators (CFLI) inform Air Force S&T investment through 
their Core Function Master Plan(s) (CFMP).  CFLIs for each Air Force Service Core 
Function (SCF) produce a CFMP in collaboration with key stakeholders across the Air Force, 
including Headquarters Air Force (HAF) functionals and the Major Commands (MAJCOM).  
As part of the CFMP process, CFLIs identify key risk areas associated with their plan and 
may establish CCTs to evaluate materiel aspects of associated capability needs and to better 
vector capability development.  The CFMPs align SCF strategy, operating concepts, and 
capability development, to include S&T specifically focused toward their SCF, to provide 20 
to 30-year constructs for enhancing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power 
across the range of military operations (AF/A8 responsible for Air Force strategy and SCF 
policy matters). 
1.1.3.  The Air Force S&T planning process provides a framework for the operational, 
acquisition, and S&T communities to work together in order to understand Air Force 
capability needs, identify associated technology needs and potential solutions, and then 
develop technology options for acquisition and operational community consideration.  An 
input to this process may be capability needs identified through Capabilities-Based 
Assessments (CBA) or other capability planning analyses (refer to AFI 10-601, Operational 
Capability Requirements Development for more information on CBAs).  A wide range of 
technology solution providers should be considered throughout Air Force S&T planning 
activities as necessary (e.g., Air Force Research Laboratory [AFRL], Army Research 
Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
[DARPA], National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], academia, industry, and 
appropriate foreign sources).

1.1.4.  The Air Force S&T planning framework is depicted in Figure 1.1  It reflects how 
S&T planning and governance fit within the larger DoD and Service planning, programming, 
and governance constructs.  The box at the center top represents the technology needs and 
solutions identification process which encompass a range of collaborative activities.  
Collaboration among the MAJCOMs/CFLIs, acquisition centers, Program Executive Officers 
(PEO), and the Technology Executive Officer (TEO) is essential to (1) ensure S&T 
stakeholders understand Air Force capability needs and associated technology needs in order 
to develop potential technology solutions addressing those needs, and (2) to inform Air Force 
senior leaders, MAJCOMs, and the acquisition community of technology opportunities and 
the art of the possible.

1.1.5.  Once technology needs are understood and potential solutions identified, S&T 
governance reviews, integrates, prioritizes, endorses, and commissions S&T efforts as 
appropriate.  The ATCs provide a forum to review a wide range of S&T matters.  At a 
minimum, ATCs review and approve ATDs, recommend candidate FCCs for consideration 
by the Air Force S&T Group and Board, and review the S&T portfolio supporting each 
respective SCF.  The Air Force S&T Group and Board are embedded within the S&T 
planning framework and are responsible for assessing and integrating Air Force technology 
needs, vetting and prioritizing candidate FCCs, and deliberating on other S&T matters as 
required.  The Air Force S&T Group is an O-6 level body that makes recommendations to 
the Air Force S&T Board with respect to issues brought before the Group for consideration.  
Significant S&T programs endorsed by the Air Force S&T Board (e.g., FCCs, JCTDs, HAF-
level S&T-related MOAs and MOUs) are validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight 
Council (AFROC). 
1.1.6.  To execute the S&T component of commissioned ATDs, JCTDs, and FCCs, the TEO 
assigns an S&T program manager and is responsible for resourcing the S&T effort; the

Chapter 2 
AIR FORCE S&T PLANNING 
2.1.  Air Force S&T Planning.  The Air Force will plan its S&T Program in accordance with 
the approved Air Force S&T Strategy and guidance and planning documents associated with the 
AFSPS (reference AFPD 90-11).  The foundation of the S&T planning process is an agreed-upon 
set of maintained S&T core competencies balanced with an investment portfolio of basic 
research, applied research, and advanced technology development that produce both evolutionary 
and revolutionary technologies.  During Air Force S&T planning, near-, mid-, and far-term 
warfighter capability needs, affordability, performance, competitive incentives, sustainability, 
industrial base, and energy use are considered.  Air Force S&T funds may be applied in the 
absence of a validated user requirement or programmed funding for formal acquisition. 
2.2.  Capability Collaboration Team Technology Needs Identification.  The CBA forms the 
analytic basis for how capability needs are identified and is an integral part of the capabilities 
planning process.  For documented MAJCOM/CFLI capability needs that require materiel 
solutions, CFLIs will establish CCTs to determine if S&T is required to address any associated 
technology needs.  The CCTs will include subject matter expert representatives from the 
MAJCOM/CFLI, appropriate Center and/or PEO, AFRL, and other stakeholders as appropriate. 
The output of the CCTs is a set of vetted technology needs required for ongoing or prospective 
materiel solutions supporting documented capability needs.  Technology needs resulting from 
this process may be documented and prioritized by CFLIs in their CFMPs. 
Figure 2.1.  Role of S&T within Capability Development Process.

2.3.  Capability Collaboration Team Technology Solutions Formulation.  Following 
technology needs collaboration, CCTs will continue to identify potential technology solutions 
  10  
AFI61-101  14 MARCH 2013 
that address the identified technology needs.  Recommended technology solutions resulting from 
this process may become S&T projects that AFRL initiates and executes through internal 
planning processes or may be proposed as candidate ATDs, FCCs, or JCTDs which require 
approval by their respective governing bodies.  Furthermore, technology solutions may 
necessitate a collaborative development activity with another Service or United States 
Government organization requiring an MOA or MOU.  International partners should be 
considered when potential technology solutions are investigated in order to access foreign 
expertise, funding, and strengthen S&T cooperation.  As shown in Figure 2.1, S&T activities 
will inform capability planning and foster related technology maturation efforts to reduce system 
acquisition risks.  Technology needs identification and technology solutions formulation 
processes also inform Air Force S&T governance, the AFSPS, and the Air Force planning, 
programming, and budgeting processes. 
2.4.  Technology Transition Plans (TTP).  Stakeholder organizations participate in technology 
transition planning once an S&T solution is deemed necessary to support a MAJCOM/CFLI 
capability need and associated Center technology need.  For solutions that may become ATDs or 
FCCs, formation of an IPT is necessary for transition planning to include development and 
execution of the TTP. The IPT membership can be drawn from the existing CCTs as appropriate 
and at a minimum, should include the MAJCOM/CFLI, Lead Center and/or PEO, and laboratory.  
AFMC and AFSPC, as appropriate, will ensure the establishment of transition planning IPTs and 
completion of the associated TTPs once commissioned. 
2.4.1.  TTPs document roles and responsibilities of organizational participants in S&T 
programs. 
2.4.2.  TTPs for ATDs and FCCs must include the elements listed below in Table 2.1. 
Table 2.1.  Required Elements for Technology Transition Plans. 
Description of Air Force capability and technology need the S&T program will address 
Description of S&T program, objectives, and schedule 
Identification of resources required (funding, manpower, etc.) to execute the S&T program 
Description of plan to transition the technology and associated acquisition or sustainment strategy 
Estimation of resources required for follow-on transition, acquisition, or sustainment activities 
Enumeration of organizational roles and responsibilities 
Signature Page (with signatories from the appropriate MAJCOM/CFLI, Center or PEO, and laboratory) 
2.5.  Memorandum of Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding.  The Air Force will 
periodically enter into formal agreements with other Services and outside agencies (e.g., 
DARPA, NASA) to execute S&T projects, conduct demonstrations, or to mature technologies 
with the intent to transition to an acquisition or sustainment program.  For the purpose of this 
instruction, these are referred to as “S&T-related MOAs/MOUs.”  Air Force-level MOAs and 
MOUs are those MOAs/MOUs requiring HAF-level signature and should be used to document 
AFI61-101  14 MARCH 2013 
  11  
the commitments and obligations of each organization for an S&T project, both during and after 
completion of the S&T activity. 
2.5.1.  S&T-related MOAs or MOUs that require HAF signature must be reviewed and 
endorsed by the Air Force S&T Group and Board (reference Chapter 3 of this instruction) 
before submission to the AFROC for validation.  Due to rapid timelines associated with 
MOAs/MOUs, coordination and approval of documents may occur electronically. 
2.5.2.  All Air Force S&T-related MOAs or MOUs with other Services and non-Air Force 
government agencies or organizations must include the elements listed in Table 2.2 in 
addition to complying with the requirements of DOD Instruction 4000.19, Interservice and 
Intragovernmental Support Agreements, 9 August 1995. 
Table 2.2.  Required Elements for S&T-related MOA and MOU. 
Description of Air Force capability need or technology challenge the S&T project will address

2.6.  Development Planning.  DP encompasses the engineering analysis and technical planning 
activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the fundamental path 
a materiel development will follow to effectively and affordably meet operational needs.  The 
relationship between activities supporting both DP and S&T planning are described below: 
2.6.1.  Air Force S&T planning activities must support, and take into consideration 
information resulting from, Air Force DP efforts.  S&T communities will identify technology 
maturity as well as technology opportunities (e.g., the art of the possible) to inform the 
development and consideration of candidate concepts. 
2.6.2.  AFMC or AFSPC, as appropriate, will conduct the necessary DP to assist transition of 
ATDs, FCCs, and Air Force-led JCTDs into acquisition programs.  DP communities will 
identify technology needs, technical risk areas, intelligence sensitivity and supportability

Chapter 3 
AIR FORCE S&T GOVERNANCE 
3.1.  Air Force S&T Governance.  Governance is necessary to strengthen alignment of S&T 
focus areas to Air Force-wide capability needs and to provide greater visibility and 
accountability within the Air Force S&T portfolio.  HAF, MAJCOMs, Centers, and AFRL 
participate in Air Force S&T governance.  Governance for S&T planning resides at the 
MAJCOM and HAF levels. 
3.2.  Applied Technology Councils (ATC).  ATCs are S&T governance bodies organized by 
SCF.  The S&T content and related agenda topics considered at ATCs must correspond to each 
MAJCOM/CFLI’s Program Objective Memorandum (POM) responsibilities. 
3.2.1.  Organization.  ATC membership is dictated by the unique set of missions that fall 
within each SCF.  At a minimum, each ATC must include the MAJCOM/CV (as CFLI 
representative), the appropriate AFMC and AFSPC Center commanders, and SAF/AQR, or 
their designated representatives.  AETC will be invited to all ATCs to ensure education and 
training considerations are addressed.  ATCs are chaired by the respective MAJCOM/CV.  
AFMC or AFSPC, as appropriate, will define and assign secretariat functions for each ATC. 
3.2.2.  ATCs will: 
3.2.2.1.  Be held annually, as necessary, and be completed within an appropriate 
timeframe to support the Air Force S&T Group and Board fall cycle.  If required, ATCs 
may be conducted out-of-cycle to address urgent S&T-related matters. 
3.2.2.2.  Ensure proposed S&T solutions are aligned with SCF capability needs and 
related CFMP priorities. 
3.2.2.3.  Endorse candidate FCCs for consideration by the Air Force S&T Group and 
Board. 
3.2.2.4.  Review, prioritize, and commission candidate ATDs. 
3.2.2.5.  Review status of existing ATDs to ensure organizational responsibilities are 
being conducted in accordance with the signed TTP and continue, decommission, and 
graduate ATDs as appropriate.  ATDs will graduate when S&T objectives defined in the 
TTP are met as determined by the ATC.  As appropriate, ATCs will track status of 
graduated ATDs. 
3.2.2.6.  Submit proposed HAF-level agreements with other Services and/or outside 
agencies (i.e., MOA or MOU) for execution of an S&T-related project to the Air Force 
S&T Group and Board for review and endorsement. 
3.2.2.7.  Review the S&T portfolio to include all ATDs, JCTDs, FCCs, S&T-related 
MOAs and MOUs, and other S&T projects and issues as necessary, applicable to 
capability needs aligned by Service Core Function. 
3.2.2.8.  Provide documentation of ATC decisions to organizations represented on Air 
Force S&T Group and Board, within 30 days following each ATC. 
AFI61-101  14 MARCH 2013

3.2.3.  Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATD).  ATDs are planned in collaboration 
with the operator/user and contain a clearly defined transition target.  All ATDs must: 
3.2.3.1.  Be commissioned by an ATC. 
3.2.3.2.  Have a TTP that will be signed by the MAJCOM, the appropriate Center or 
PEO, and AFRL/CC.  ATDs without a signed TTP will be decommissioned at the 
subsequent ATC review. 
3.2.3.3.  Complete S&T content within the following POM Future Years Defense 
Program (FYDP). 
3.2.4.  Flagship Capability Concepts (FCC).  All FCCs must: 
3.2.4.1.  Receive the endorsement of an ATC or, if an ATC is not held, from the 
respective MAJCOM/CV (as CFLI representative); be reviewed and prioritized by the 
Air Force S&T Group and Board; and validated by the AFROC, as documented in an 
AFROC Memorandum, before commissioning. 
3.2.4.2.  Have a TTP that will be signed by the MAJCOM, the appropriate Center or 
PEO, and AFRL/CC.  FCCs without a signed TTP will be decommissioned at the 
subsequent Air Force S&T Board review. 
3.2.4.3.  Complete S&T content within the following POM FYDP. 
3.2.5.  Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD).  JCTDs are approved and 
governed at the OSD level.  Candidate JCTDs will be reviewed and nominated by the 
appropriate CFLI(s), by the Air Force S&T Group and Board as determined by SAF/AQR, 
and sent to the AFROC for validation upon recommendation by the Air Force S&T Board. 
3.3.  Air Force S&T Group and Board.  The purpose of the Air Force S&T Group and Board is 
to ensure S&T efforts are properly aligned with Air Force needs to facilitate transition and 
ultimate deployment to the Air Force operational community.  This will be accomplished by 
assessing and integrating Air Force technology needs, reviewing and endorsing FCCs, vetting 
S&T-related MOAs and MOUs, reviewing and endorsing candidate JCTDs, and maintaining 
cognizance of MAJCOM-sponsored ATDs. 
3.3.1.  Organization.  The Air Force S&T Group is an O-6-level body and the Air Force 
S&T Board is at the 1- and 2-star level.  Membership for both includes SAF/AQR (co-chair), 
AFRL (co-chair), AF/A5R, AF/A8P, AF/A8X, SAF/AQX, ACC, AETC, AFGSC, AFMC, 
AFSPC, AFSOC, AMC, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Air Force Nuclear 
Weapons Center, and the Space and Missile Systems Center.  The Air Force Intelligence 
Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) will participate in an advisory capacity 
at the Group and Board level; the MAJCOM Chief Scientists (or equivalent) will serve as 
advisors to the Air Force S&T Board; and the Air Force Chief Scientist (AF/ST) Military 
Assistant will serve as an advisor to the Air Force S&T Group. 
3.3.2.  The Air Force S&T Group.  Makes recommendations to the Air Force S&T Board 
with respect to issues brought before the Group for consideration. 
3.3.3.  The Air Force S&T Board will:

Terms 
NOTE—This glossary helps readers understand the terms in this publication.  It is not intended 
to include all pertinent terms.  Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of 
Military and Associated Terms, 8 November 2010, and Air Force Doctrine Document 1-2, Air 
Force Glossary, 11 January 2007, contain standard terms and definitions for Department of 
Defense and Air Force use. 
Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD)—A demonstration of the maturity and potential 
of advanced technologies for enhanced military operational capability or cost effectiveness. In 
the Air Force, ATDs are commissioned by an Applied Technology Council with scope, 
objectives, and organizational responsibilities defined in a Technology Transition Plan. 
Advanced Technology Development—Research efforts that have moved beyond Applied 
Research and into the development and integration of hardware for field experiments and tests. 
Also referred to as “6.3” or RDT&E Budget Activity Code 3. 
Applied Research—Systemic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine 
the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met. Also referred to as “6.2” or 
RDT&E Budget Activity Code 2. 
Applied Technology Council (ATC)—S&T governance body organized by Service Core 
Function. 
Basic Research—Systemic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the 
fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific application towards 
processes or products in mind. It includes all scientific study and experimentation directed 
toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, 
engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs. It is 
farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress. Also referred 
to as “6.1” or RDT&E Budget Activity Code 1. 
Budget Activity—A broad category of activity contained within a specific appropriation. 
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA)—The CBA is the Joint Capabilities Integration and 
Development System analysis process.  It answers several key questions for the validation 
authority prior to their approval: define the mission; identify capabilities required; determine the 
attributes/standards of the capabilities; identify gaps/shortfalls; assess operational risk associated 
with the gaps/shortfalls; prioritize the gaps/shortfalls; identify and assess potential non-materiel 
solutions; provide recommendations for addressing the gaps/shortfalls. 
Capability Collaboration Team (CCT)—Established by CFLIs and comprised of subject 
matter experts from MAJCOM/CFLIs, Centers, and AFRL. CCTs work collaboratively to fully 
understand MAJCOM/CFLI-documented capability needs that may require a materiel solution 
and determine if S&T is required for any associated technology needs. The CCTs also 
  18  
AFI61-101  14 MARCH 2013 
collaboratively formulate potential S&T solutions (e.g., technology development, risk reduction, 
or maturation projects) to address the S&T needs previously identified. Once established, CFLIs 
may utilize CCTs to identify materiel concepts and produce capability development roadmaps 
outlining the timeframe for requirements development, DP, S&T, and acquisition activities. 
Capability Gap—The inability to execute a specified course of action. The gap may be the 
result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency or sufficiency in an existing capability 
solution, or the need to replace an existing capability solution to prevent a future gap (CJCSI 
3170.01H, 10 January 2012). 
Capability Need (or Need)—see “Capability Requirement” 
Capability Requirement (or Requirement)—A capability required to meet an organization’s 
roles, functions, and missions in current or future operations.  To the greatest extent possible, 
capability requirements are described in relation to tasks, standards, and conditions in accordance 
with the Universal Joint Task List or equivalent DoD Component Task List.  If a capability 
requirement is not satisfied by a capability solution, there is also an associated capability gap 
which carries a certain amount of risk until eliminated.  A requirement is considered to be ‘draft’ 
or ‘proposed’ until validated by the appropriate authority (CJCSI 3170.01H, 10 January 2012). 
Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI)—SECAF/CSAF-designated leader who serves as the 
principal integrators for their assigned SCFs and the corresponding Air Force CFMPs.  CFLIs 
guide SCF process and SCF-related appropriation priorities by orchestrating the development of 
SCF in collaboration with key stakeholders across the Air Force, including MAJCOMs, the Air 
Reserve Components, and functional authorities. 
Core Function Master Plan (CFMP)—Developed by CFLIs, in collaboration with all key 
stakeholders across the Air Force, including MAJCOMs, the Air Reserve Components, and 
functional authorities, CFMPs align strategy, operating concepts, and capability development by 
SCF, to provide 30-year constructs for enhancing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global 
Power across the range of military operations. 
Development Planning (DP)—Encompasses the engineering analysis and technical planning 
activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the fundamental path 
a material development will follow to effectively and affordably meet operational needs (DoDI 
5134.16, 19 August 2011). 
Flagship Capability Concept (FCC)—Similar to an ATD, an FCC is a demonstration of the 
maturity and potential of advanced technologies for enhanced military operational capability or 
cost effectiveness. FCCs are commissioned by the AFROC with scope, objectives, and 
organizational responsibilities defined in a Technology Transition Plan. 
Integrated Product Team (IPT)—A multidisciplinary group of people who are collectively 
responsible for delivering a defined product or process. 
Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD)—An OSD approved program that seeks 
to rapidly and collaboratively demonstrate, assess, and transition solutions to address Combatant 
Commanders’, Joint, Interagency, and Coalition problems. 
Materiel Solution—A new item (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, etc., 
and related spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, 
AFI61-101  14 MARCH 2013 
  19  
and utilities) developed or purchased to satisfy one or more capability requirements (or needs) 
and reduce or eliminate one or more capability gaps (CJCSI 3170.01H, 10 January 2012). 
Science and Technology (S&T)—Includes Basic Research, Applied Research, and Advanced 
Technology Development. 
Science & Technology Group and Board—S&T governance body comprised of HAF and 
MAJCOM representation. 
Service Core Function (SCF)—SCFs delineate the appropriate and assigned core duties, 
missions, and tasks of the Air Force as an organization, responsibility for each of which is 
assigned to a CFLI.  SCFs express the ways in which the Air Force is particularly and 
appropriately suited to contribute to national security.  SCFs are an integral aspect of the AFSPS, 
and provide the framework for Air Force organizing, training, and equipping efforts. 
Technology Executive Officer (TEO)—The individual dedicated to executive management and 
supervision of the Air Force S&T portfolio, analogous to a Program Executive Officer. The TEO 
shall be appointed and assigned by, and is accountable to, the Air Force Service Acquisition 
Executive. 
Technology Need—Technology that is unavailable, but potentially attainable, and determined 
necessary for ongoing or prospective materiel solution(s) that support a capability need(s). 
Technology Solution—Technology project or program, either ongoing or proposed, that address 
a technology need(s). 
Technology Transition—Process of inserting critical technology into military systems to 
provide effective weapons and support system needed by the warfighter to carry out assigned 
missions. 
Technology Transition Plan (TTP)—Defines scope, objectives, and organizational roles and 
responsibilities for an S&T project or program (e.g., ATD, FCC).
